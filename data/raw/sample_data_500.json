      "We examine whether the sorting of differently achieving students into differently sized classes results in a regressive or compensatory pattern of class sizes for a sample of national school systems. Sorting effects are identified by subtracting the causal effect of class size on performance from their total correlation. Our empirical results indicate substantial compensatory sorting within and especially between schools in many countries. Only the United States, a country with decentralized education finance and considerable residential mobility, exhibits regressive between-school sorting. Between-school sorting is more compensatory in systems with ability tracking. Within-school sorting is more compensatory when administrators rather than teachers assign students to classrooms."

      "Hostility towards minorities may sometimes have economic rather than racial motives. Labour market fears, or concerns about the welfare system, are often believed to manifest themselves in hostile attitudes towards population groups that are considered to be competitors for these resources. The question of how attitudes of majority populations towards immigration are determined is of great importance for implementing appropriate policies. We try to separate racial and economic components to such attitudes. Our analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey, which includes questions on attitudes towards immigration from different minority groups, as well as attitudes towards related concerns, like job security and benefit expenditures. We specify and estimate a multiple factor model. The correlation between answers to questions on immigration and on related issues helps us separate different aspects to attitudes. We find that racial attitudes are strongly associated with hostility to immigration from ethnically distinct populations. Furthermore, there is evidence that welfare and labour market concerns are related to attitudes to immigration, but only among skilled and highly educated workers."

      "Our objective in this paper is to assess the acceptability of the ambient tax. Concretely, we ask subjects to choose between (A) an ambient tax and (B) an individual tax system. In case (A), they actually participate in a game in which their payo depends on all participants' decisions and on natural variability as would be the case in the real world if an ambient tax was implemented. In case (B) they simply earn a sure payo ; which is supposed to re ect their maximal pro t under the individual tax system. We take the percentage of agents preferring the ambient tax to a given sure payo level as an indicator of the acceptability of the ambient tax given this sure payo level. Our experimental results mitigate the common belief that am- bient taxes are totally unacceptable. If the sure alternative to the ambient tax policy is very costly for the polluters, for example because it involves high inspection costs, polluters might eventually prefer being liable to an ambient tax."

We find that the business cycle dynamics in the OLG model in response to both a technology shock and a monetary shock are similar, but not completely identical to those found in the corresponding representative-agent model. In particular, working hours in the OLG model decrease in response to a positive technological shock, since for young workers the income effect dominates the substitution effect. This is in line with the adverse effect of productivity shocks on employment found in structural vector autoregressions."

      "In 2005, the EU introduced an emissions trading system in order to pursue its Kyoto obligations. This instrument gives emitters the flexibility to undertake reduction measures in the most cost-efficient way and mobilizes market forces for the protection of the earth?s climate. In this paper, we analyse the effects of emissions trading in Europe, with some special reference to the case of Germany. We look at the value of the flexibility gained by trading compared to fixed quotas. The analysis will be undertaken with a modified version of the GTAP-E model using the latest GTAP version 6 data base. It is based on the national allocation plans as submitted to and approved by the EU. We find that, if the NAP is combined with a regional emissions trading scheme, then Germany, Great Britain, and Czech Republic are the main sellers of emissions permits, while Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden are the main buyers. The welfare gains from regional emissions trading \u2013 for the trading sectors only - are largest for Belgium, Denmark, and Great Britain; smaller for Finland, Sweden, and smallest for Germany and other regions. When we take into account the economy-wide and terms of trade effects of emissions trading, however, the (negative) terms of trade effects can offset the (positive) allocative efficiency gains for the cases of the Netherland and Italy, while all other regions ended up with positive net welfare gains. All regions, however, experienced positive increases in real GDP as a result of regional emissions trading."

      "This study argues that the political considerations were an important factor behind the crisis of the Brazilian real in January 1999. The divided coalition government and a president facing impending elections eschewed the correction of external misalignments and the fiscal austerity at a time when the markets were already excited by the 1997-98 East Asian and 1998 Russian financial crises. The hypothesis is established after confirming the vulnerability of Brazilian economy to currency crisis through Masson's model of multiple equilibrium and then it is tested by running a maximum likelihood logit regression."

      "The origin of increasing income inequality and strategies to influence this unwarranted development has stimulated major debates during the 1990s under economists, politicians and the general public in a number of OECD countries and the U.S. in particular. While this topic includes a broader agenda the focus of our paper is on possible sources of increasing wage inequality. The paper summarizes major theoretical arguments to explain these developments based on a simple comparative static model of the labor market with two inputs, skilled and unskilled labor. Current theories of labor markets identify demand and supply shifts and institutional factors affecting the income dispersion. Skill-biased technological change and trade liberalization are recognized as the major drivers of demand shifts. While these demand shifts tend to rise income inequality, the increasing supply of skilled workers influences income in the opposite direction. A third set of institutional factors influence wage dispersion like e.g. minimum wages or unionization as well as labor market legislation or other labor market regulations. These institutional factors tend to influence functional wage inequality compared to a pure competitive market solution. However institutional arrangements normally do not attempt to clear labor markets and therefore implicitly contribute to unemployment. The low level of unskilled unemployment as well as of unemployment in general in the U.S. during the 1990s compared to continental Europe and Germany in particular has lead to the statement of the trade-off hypothesis by Krugman that the high unemployment in Europe is just the other side of the medal where increasing wage inequality is subdued by institutional arrangements. This hypothesis is controversially discussed by other authors because of contradicting or inconclusive empirical evidence. Increasing wage inequality might bring down unemployment in Europe but will contribute on the other hand to phenomena like the working poor in the U.S. While this dilemma cannot be overcome following the trade-off hypothesis it is a more promising strategy in the long-run to focus economic policy responses to improve the supply side conditions for skill formation. By summing up empirical research results on this issue for the U.S. and Germany the authors attempt to assess to what extent these theoretical explanation are sufficient to give an appropriate account what is observed in reality."

      "In 2001 and 2002, Sweden introduced several unemployment insurance reforms. A major innovation in the first reform was the introduction of a two-tiered benefit structure for some unemployed individuals. This system involved supplementary compensation during the first 20 weeks of unemployment. The 2002 reform retained the two-tiered benefit structure but involved also substantial benefit hikes for spells exceeding 20 weeks. This paper examines how these reforms affected transitions from unemployment to employment. We take advantage of the fact that the reforms had quasi-experimental features where the ?treatments? differed considerably among unemployed individuals. We find that the reforms had strikingly different effects on job finding among men and women. The two reforms in conjunction are estimated to have increased the expected duration of unemployment among men but to have decreased the duration of unemployment among women. The overall effect on the duration of unemployment is not statistically different from zero. However, the reforms reduced job finding among males who remained unemployed for more than 20 weeks."

      "In der Debatte \u00fcber Integrationspolitik f\u00fcr Personen mit Migrationshintergrund kommt der Teilnahme am Arbeitsmarkt eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle zu. Der Einstieg \u00fcber die duale Berufsausbildung stellt f\u00fcr Jugendliche allgemein - aber insbesondere f\u00fcr Migranten, die in den h\u00f6heren Bildungsabschl\u00fcssen unterrepr\u00e4sentiert sind - eine wichtige Zugangsvoraussetzung dar. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der Berufseinstieg von Migranten und Deutschen untersucht, die eine Ausbildung im dualen Ausbildungssystem in Deutschland erfolgreich abgeschlossen haben. Diese Erwerbsphase ist deshalb von besonderer Relevanz, da sie f\u00fcr den weiteren Berufsverlauf stark pr\u00e4gend ist. Auf Basis der Abschlusskohorte 2002 wird sowohl der erfolgreiche Einstieg nach der Ausbildung untersucht, als auch die Nachhaltigkeit mittels der Dauer der ersten Besch\u00e4ftigungsphase analysiert. Dazu werden theoretische Erkl\u00e4rungsmuster erl\u00e4utert, die Bildungs- und Arbeitsmarktbeteiligung von Ausl\u00e4ndern in den letzten Jahren thematisiert und nach Ausbildungsberufen unterschieden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen f\u00fcr T\u00fcrken ein deutlich erh\u00f6htes Arbeitslosigkeitsrisiko beim Einstieg, w\u00e4hrend f\u00fcr sonstige Migranten der Arbeitsmarkteintritt zwar h\u00e4ufiger mit einer Teilzeitbesch\u00e4ftigung erfolgt, aber im Vergleich zu Deutschen nur ein leicht h\u00f6heres Arbeitslosigkeitsrisiko vorliegt. F\u00fcr die Nachhaltigkeit der ersten Besch\u00e4ftigungsphase f\u00fcr diejenigen Absolventen, die direkt im Anschluss an ihre Ausbildung eine Besch\u00e4ftigung gefunden haben, zeigen sich keine nationenspezifischen Unterschiede."

      "This paper uses data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) to examine the relationship between nutritional status and both longer-run household resources and short-run fluctuations in household resources. We evaluate six measures of nutrition \u2013 gross energy intake, two dimensions of diet quality, body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of net energy intake for adults, and for children, weight for height and stature. Our finding indicate a clear positive effect of longer-run resources on energy intake, diet composition, adult BMI, and child stature. Between 1996 and 2000, Russian households experienced a dramatic decline in income and expenditure and then an equally dramatic rise. We exploit the panel nature of RLMS to identify the causal effect of changes in household resources on nutritional status. In contrast to the large decline in expenditure in 1998, nutritional status appears to be very resilient to variation in household resources and this is reflected in gross energy intake, adult BMI, and child stature, which all change very little as expenditure deviates from its long-run average. Diet composition, however, does change in response to transitory variation in household resources. It appears that individuals and households are able to weather large economic crises at least in terms of maintaining body mass and energy intake."

      "Using a structural dynamic programming model, we investigate the relative importance of family background variables and individual specific abilities in explaining cross-sectional differences in schooling attainments and wages. Given scholastic ability, household background variables (especially parents' education) account for 68% of the explained crosssectional variations in schooling attainments. When the effects of household background variables on ability are also taken into account, the percentage raises to 85%. However, individual differences in wages are mostly explained by abilities. Only 27% of the explained variation in wages is accounted for by parents? background variables as opposed to 73% by unobserved abilities (orthogonal to family background variables). When scholastic ability is correlated with family background variables, ability endowments explain as much as 81% of individual wages."

      "Increasing earnings inequality has been an important feature of the US and UK labour markets in recent years. The increase appears to be related to an increased demand for skilled labour and an increase in the returns to education. In this paper we examine what has happened to earnings inequality and the returns to education in Ireland between 1987 and 1997. We find that while both increased between 1987 and 1994, the increases slowed dramatically between 1994 and 1997. This is somewhat surprising as the exceptional growth in the Irish economy occurred from 1994 on. We look to immigration as being a contributing factor to this pattern because a large group of skilled workers flowed into the Irish labour market between 1994 and 1997. We develop a model of the Irish labour market and use it to simulate the impact of an increase in skilled labour. The simulation suggests that immigration did indeed reduce earnings inequality. This result is an interesting corollary to work from the US that shows the immigration of unskilled workers increasing earnings inequality."

      "The paper deals with the complexity of legal norms and the instrument the German constitutional law establishes to control it, namely the requirement of normative clarity. First, I introduce a definition of complexity of written legal norms, conceptualized by their density (number of items to be considered) and interdependencies (within a norm and of different norms), thus focussing on the complexity of the underlying rule, rather than its language. Complexity is then described as a primarily cognitive problem, with reflexes on the time and monetary scales. The view taken here is therefore a subjective one, setting out from the individual who tries to understand a legal text. The technicality of a norm can reduce complexity for those trained in the law, and at the same time raise it for laypeople. Legal doctrine, too, aims at reinforcing consistence and reducing complexity. The requirement of normative clarity, however, is not a means to reduce complexity, but only to control it. Normative clarity is held to be founded in the principle of the separation of powers, and its measure is the executability of the law. Against concurrent views, I therefore argue that it is not the norm's addressee who must understand the norm, but rather lawyers. Only then can the problem of legal complexity be handled in systems that rely heavily on statutory law. The argument is supported by theoretical, behavioural and doctrinal reasons."

      "What is the relation between infrequent price adjustment and the dynamic response of the aggregate price level to monetary shocks? The answer to this question ranges from a one-to-one-link (Calvo, 1983) to no connection whatsoever (Caplin and Spulber, 1987). The purpose of this paper is to provide a unified framework to understand the mechanismus behind this wide range of results. In doing so, we propose new interpretations of key results in this area, which in turn suggest the kind of Ss model that is likely to generate substantial price rigidity. The first result we revisit is Caplin and Spulber's monetary neutrality model. We show that when price stickiness is measured in terms of the impulse response function, this result is not a consequence of aggregation, but is due instead to the absence of price-stickiness at the microeconomic level. We also show that the selection effect, according to which units that adjust their prices are those that benefit the most, is neither necessary nor sufficient to account for the higher aggregate flexibility of Ss-type models compared to Calvo models. Instead, the key concept is the contribution of the extensive margin of adjustment to the aggregate price response. The aggregate price level is more flexible than suggested by the microeconomic frequency of adjustment if and only if this term is positive,"

      "The relationship between CEO pay and performance has been much analyzed in the management and economics literature. This study analyzes the structure of executive compensation in family and non-family firms. In line with predictions of agency theory, it is found that the share of base salary is higher with family-member CEOs than it is with nonfamily member CEOs. Furthermore, family-member CEOs receive a lower share of option pay. The paper's findings have implications for family business research and the executive compensation literature. To make the findings robust, the statistical analysis is performed with both Bayesian and classical frequentist methods."

In addition, the results show that free riding can be beneficial for a team in combination with strategic mismatching and that the loser?s curse may be welfare improving by mitigating the problem of strategic mismatching."

It examines the determinants of work-related stress and explores the importance of work-related stress as a predictor of individuals' quitting behaviour and the rate of absenteeism. We find that those individuals reporting to experience at least some stress in their current position are 10 - 14 % more likely to hold intentions to quit or be absent from work than those without any job stress, with the probability of intending to quit or being absent increasing with successively higher workrelated stress levels."

Using the EUREX D3047 tick data from the German stock index, it can be shown that the temporal dependence structure of price movements is not always negatively correlated as assumed in the stylized facts in the finance literature. Depending on the sampling frequency, the estimated copulas exhibit some kind of overreaction phenomena and multiple tail dependence, revealing patterns similar to the compass rose."

      "This paper estimates a common component in many price series that has an equiproportional effect on all prices. Changes in this component can be interpreted as changes in the value of the numeraire since, by definition, they leave all relative prices unchanged. The first aim of the paper is to measure these changes. The paper provides a framework for identifying this component, suggests an estimator for the component based on a dynamic factor model, and assesses its performance relative to alternative estimators. Using 187 U.S. time-series on prices, we estimate changes in the value of the numeraire from 1960 to 2006, and further decompose these changes into a part that is related to relative price movements and a residual 'exogenous' part. The second aim of the paper is to use these estimates to investigate two economic questions. First, we show that the size of exogenous changes in the value of the numeraire helps distinguish between different theories of pricing, and that the U.S. evidence argues against several strict theories of nominal rigidities. Second, we find that changes in the value of the numeraire are significantly related to changes in real quantities, and discuss interpretations of this apparent non-neutrality."

      "We consider a portfolio optimization problem in a Black-Scholes model with n stocks, in which an investor faces both fixed and proportional transaction costs. The performance of an investment strategy is measured by the average return of the corresponding portfolio over an infinite time horizon. At first, we derive a representation of the portfolio value process, which only depends on the relative fractions of the total portfolio value that the investor holds in the different stocks. This representation allows us to consider these so-called risky fractions as the decision variables of the investor. We show a certain kind of stationarity (Harris recurrence) for a quite flexible class of strategies (constant boundary strategies). Then, using renewal theoretic methods, we are able to describe the asymptotic return by the behaviour of the risky fractions in a typical period between two trades. Our results generalize those of [4], who considered a financial market model with one bond and one stock, to a market with a finite number n>1 of stocks."

      "We examine the performance of volatility models that incorporate features such as long (short) memory, regime-switching and multifractality along with two competing distributional assumptions of the error component, i.e. Normal vs Student-t. Our precise contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a new model to the family of Markov-Switching Multifractal models of asset returns (MSM), namely, the Markov-Switching Multifractal model of asset returns with Student-t innovations (MSM-t). Second, we perform a comprehensive panel forecasting analysis of the MSM models as well as other competing volatility models of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) legacy. Our cross-sections consist of all-share equity indices, bond indices and real estate security indices at the country level. Furthermore, we investigate complementarities between models via combined forecasts. We find that: (i) Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation are both suitable for MSM-t models, (ii) empirical panel forecasts of MSM-t models show an improvement over the alternative volatility models in terms of mean absolute forecast errors and that (iii) forecast combinations obtained from the different MSM and (FI)GARCH models considered appear to provide some improvement upon forecasts from single models."

We develop a model of time use, and demonstrate that its consistency with the behaviour of British working couples in the 1990s. We present evidence of the synchronisation of working hours by spouses and report estimates indicating that propensities to engage in associative activity depend on the availability of Suitable Leisure Companions outside the household. Our results indicate the importance of externalities in the working time decisions of individuals."

      "The literature has shown that product market frictions and firms dynamic play a crucial role in reconciling standard DSGE with several stylized facts. This paper studies optimal monetary policy in a DSGE model with sticky prices and oligopolistic competition. In this model firms' monopolistic rents induce both intra-temporal and intertemporal time-varying wedges which induce inefficient fluctuations of employment and consumption. The monetary authority faces a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and reducing inefficient fluctuations, which is resolved by using consumer price inflation as a state contingent sale subsidy. An analysis of the welfare gains of alternative rules show that targeting mark-ups and asset prices might improve upon a strict inflation targeting."

      "This paper presents a model of the implementation of IMF programs, which is empirically tested with data from the period 1975-99. The IMF and the borrowing country are shown to have asymmetric evaluations of a program?s discounted benefits, due to differences in the measurement of the benefits, the relevant time frame and appropriate discount rate. The model also distinguishes between a government that seeks to maximize national welfare and an autocracy that seeks only to benefit the ruling group. The results of the empirical analysis demonstrate that program implementation is affected by a country?s trade openness, the ideological cohesion of the government, the duration of the political regime, and the degree of political openness."

      "Biographical information on a sample of renowned U.S. inventors is combined with information on the patents they received over their careers, and employed to highlight the implications of patent institutions for markets in inventions and for democratization. The United States deliberately created a patent system that differed from existing European systems in ways that significantly affected the course of technological change. Patent rights in the U.S. helped to define and enforce tradable assets in new technological knowledge. By facilitating access to such markets in technology, patents enhanced the benefits to relatively disadvantaged individuals who might otherwise have been unable to directly extract returns from their technological creativity, and their response to such incentives increased overall technological progress. For this reason, despite the defects of patent monopolies, developing economies today may still advance technological progress and improve social welfare by providing broad access to property rights in inventions."

      "Do Walrasian markets function orderly in the presence of adverse selection? In particular, is their outcome efficient? This paper addresses these questions in the context of a Rothschild and Stiglitz insurance economy. We identify an externality associated with the presence of adverse selection as a special form of consumption externality. Consequently, we show that while competitive equilibria always exist, they are not typically incentive efficient. However, as markets for pollution rights can internalize environmental externalities, markets for consumption rights can be designed so as to internalize the consumption externality due to adverse selection. With such markets competitive equilibria exist and are always incentive efficient. Moreover, any incentive efficient allocation can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium."

      "Although urban China has experienced a rapid income growth over the last twenty years, nutrition intake for the low income group declined in the 1990s. Does this imply a zero or negative income elasticity for the low income group? This paper examines this issue using large representative sample of repeated cross-sectional data for the period 1986-2000. It is found that income elasticities of calorie consumption for urban households are far from zero, and the lower the income level the higher the income elasticity. The main reason for the reduction in calorie consumption for the low income group in the early 1990s was a sharp increase in food price. In addition, in the mid to late 1990s large scale social welfare reform increased households? need to pay for education, medical, housing expenses and the need to save for future consumption and income uncertainty. These factors seem to have played an important role in suppressing nutrition consumption of the low income group during this period."

      "CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage) is an issue which has received increasing attention in the debate on climate change over the last several years because of its relative technical simplicity and very large potential in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The absence of secondary benefits and uncertainties associated with this approach, however, would require analysts to conduct fine cost-benefit comparisons vis-\u00e0-vis other mitigation options. The paper is to provide a perspective on future cost-benefit discussions of CCS by highlighting the optimality of CCS use viewed as a non-renewable resource with a limited capacity. Scarcity of CCS (storage) capacity should involve a shadow price which could raise CCS's effective price - this is a fair assumption given the technological assessments of CCS so far, but no economic study has explicitly investigated this characteristic before. By using a simple analytical dynamic optimization model, we examine the optimal paths of CCS use, CCS's real price inclusive of the shadow price, and their difference from the operational price. A particular implication of the model is that if all else is equal, the shadow price of CCS could make the technology relatively less attractive than renewable energy due to CCS's reliance on scarce reservoirs and the resultant shadow value. This serves as a justification for giving differentiated incentives to different CO2 reduction options: more precisely, more encouragement should be given to renewable energy in comparison to CCS."

Au\u00dferdem wird zum ersten Mal das Erwerbspersonenpotenzial und die Stille Reserve in den neuen L\u00e4ndern nach der Wende auf der Basis von nach Alter und Geschlecht strukturierten Potenzialerwerbsquoten ermittelt. Das neu gesch\u00e4tzte Erwerbspersonenpotenzial liegt durchg\u00e4ngig \u00fcber den alten Sch\u00e4tzungen, w\u00e4hrend die neu berechnete Stille Reserve im Niveau niedriger ist.

      "In this paper we investigate the dynamic adjustment of labour and capital in German and Dutch firms. The Dutch labour market is characterised by greater flexibility in wages and work arrangements in comparison to Germany. These institutional differences imply that employment dynamics in the two countries should differ, and in particular, labour adjustment in the Netherlands should be more responsive to economic changes. On the other hand, there is unlikely to be such a divergence in capital dynamics as investment conditions are similar. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, there is no evidence that labour market regulations in the two countries affect the dynamics of capital adjustment."

      "Chile approved in early 2008 the replacement of her two current non-contributory subsidies for the old poor for a unified program with a pioneering design, with phase-in ending in 2012. This paper describes the political economy of this reform and evaluates it with regards to efficiency and equity. The design is analogous to one adopted in Finland in 1957, with two differences: First, the subsidy withdrawal rate in response to the individual's contributory pension benefit is lower, about 30% rather than 50%. Second, preserving a tradition introduced in 1975, benefits are also withdrawn in response to per capita household income."

      "No two ways about it: the soccer World Cup competition in June 2006 in Germany was a great experience, not only for the soccer fans, and it still resonates far and wide. The various commentaries have all concluded that the economic effects were positive. Emphasis has often been placed on increased turnover in the retail trade, overnight accommodation, receipts from tourism and effects on employment. The present study shows that this reasoning is mostly of little value and may even be incorrect. Of more significance, however, are other (measurable) effects such as the novelty effect of the stadiums, the improved image for Germany and the feelgood effect for the population."

      "We study the implications of ownership and its induced incentives on firm survival on the stock market for young and high-tech firms. Using a unique data set of all 341 firms listed on the Neuer Markt, the German counterpart of the NASDAQ, our results differ from studies on more traditional firms. Ownership by CEOs has no influence on firm survival when introducing measurements of human capital and intellectual property rights. This confirms assumptions that firms in the knowledge based industries differ also in their governance structure from traditional firms."

We explain the evolution of income-nonresponse in the GSOEP and demonstrate the importance of a discrimination between refusing the income-statement or don't know."

      "The development of production, prices and employment in the EU electrical industry between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s is analysed in order to test the hypothesis that the competitive pressure from low-income countries has led to the observed decline of the employment share of low-skilled workers. The direct effect of increased import competition on relative employment seems to be small, except for the case of consumer electronics. Apparently, adjustment strategies induced by globalisation pressures (e.g., investment in machinery and R&D) had a large skill bias. Structural change both between and within major subsegments of the electrical industry is analysed in more detail for the case of West Germany."

      "The gender relationship, characterised to a high degree by the gender-specific division of labour into paid work and housework, is in the process of change. In Germany, however, housework continues to be considered a typically female chore. The present study considers the empirical relevance of three theoretical approaches to gender-specific time allocation from the economic and social sciences. The various models are assessed using the Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) for the year 2000. The estimation results imply that no single theory can be favoured as opposed to any other. Accordingly, prevalent approaches to the explanation of household division of labour are at the same time equally suited and unsuited to grasping the problem empirically. A person's individual housework time is determined by both economic and ideological characteristics. Following on from the evaluation of different theories, an approach is evaluated which simultaneously takes individual work time and paid work time into account. This integrative evaluation shows that the economic rational choice model finds only limited application in the area of private households, thus pointing to the necessity for an interdisciplinary treatment of the subject."

Unlike many studies of heterogeneous objects where the effect of the order of sale on the price may not be credibly identified, the effect of the order is identified here because the items are randomly selected for sale. In a further contrast to many other studies, these data indicate that the prices tend to increase as the auction proceeds. The data also indicate that once several items have been sold, there is no change in the bidding behavior or further increase in prices."

      "We estimate and analyze the global income distribution from national log-normal income distributions for the years 1970 to 2003, as well as the income distribution of seven regional subsamples. From these distributions we obtain measures for global and regional inequality and poverty, and find decreasing global poverty and inequality during the time period. By decomposing inequality into within and between country inequality using Theils' measure of inequality, we observe declining inequality between countries whereas overall inequality within countries increased. Furthermore, we calculate growth incidence curves for five year periods between 1970 and 2003, as well as a growth incidence curve for the entire period and corresponding rates of pro-poor growth. In the global income distribution, the 8.5th to 63.5th global income percentiles experienced above average percentile growth rates, while the remaining very lowest quantiles experienced also the lowest percentile growth rates. Using the regional decomposition we find that while in 1970 more than half of the worlds extreme poor and poor people lived in East Asia, it is Sub-Saharan Africa where nowadays two thirds of the extreme poor and half of the worlds poor live."

      "Policies of lowering carbon demand may aggravate rather than alleviate climate change (green paradox). In a two-period three-country general equilibrium model with finite endowment of fossil fuel one country enforces an emissions cap in the first or second period. When that cap is tightened the extent of carbon leakage depends on the interaction of various parameters and elasticities. Conditions for the green paradox are specified. All determinants of carbon leakage resulting from tightening the first-period cap work in opposite direction when the second-period cap is tightened. Tightening the second-period cap does not necessarily lead to the green paradox."

      "When workers adopt technology at the point where the costs equal the increased productivity, output per worker increases immediately, while the productivity benefits increase only gradually if the costs continue to fall. As a result, workers in computer-adopting labor market groups experience an immediate fall in wages due to increased supply. On the other hand, adopting workers experience wage increases with some delay. This model explains why increased computer use does not immediately lead to higher wage inequality. More specifically, the results of the model are shown to be consistent with the question why withingroup wage inequality among skilled workers as a result of computer technology adoption in the United States increased in the 1970s, while between-group wage inequality and withingroup wage inequality among the unskilled did not start to increase until the 1980s. The model also suggests that the slow diffusion of computer technology in Germany along with the absence of major changes in the wage structure in the 1980s is consistent with the more compressed German wage structure. Finally, the theoretical predictions seem to be of the right magnitude to explain the empirical quantities observed in the data."

      "We study a policy game between exporting and importing countries in vertically linked industries. In a successive international Cournot oligopoly, we analyse incentives for using tax instruments strategically to shift rents vertically, between exporting and importing countries, and horizontally, between exporting countries. We show that the equilibrium outcome depends crucially on the relative degree of competitiveness in the upstream and downstream parts of the industry. With respect to national welfare, a more competitive upstream industry may benefit an exporting (upstream) country and harm an importing (downstream) country. On the other hand, a more competitive downstream industry may harm exporting countries."

      "We present a new and simple empirical methodology to identify relative wage rigidity dynamics. The methodology is applied to data from the Polish Labour Force Survey for the period 1994 to 1998. We estimate ceteris paribus changes in relative wage and unemployment differentials for various labour market defining characteristics. A simultaneous increase in the relative wage and the unemployment likelihood is defined as a relative wage rigidity dynamic for a labour market characteristic. We find that the Polish wage structure generated hardly any rigidities between 1994 and 1998 nor did it reduce possibly existing rigidities during that period."

      "This paper examines the growth effects of an increase of capital income taxes with additional revenue being devoted to cut wage-related social security contributions to reduce unemployment. The analysis is carried out in an overlapping generations model with endogenous growth, unemployment and a social security system comprising pensions and unemployment benefits. It is shown that the reform not only promotes employment but may additionally stimulate economic growth. Calibrating the model to match data for the EU15 reveals that European countries can indeed gain in form of higher employment and growth if the initial capital income tax is not too high."

      "Seit M\u00e4rz 2002 haben Arbeitslose mit Anspr\u00fcchen auf Lohnersatzleistungen (Arbeitslosengeld, Arbeitslosenhilfe oder Anschlussunterhaltsgeld) Anrecht auf einen Vermittlungsgutschein (VGS), sofern sie nach drei Monaten noch nicht vermittelt wurden (\u00a7 421g SGB III). Der Anspruch auf einen Vermittlungsgutschein besteht nur befristet bis zum 31. Dezember 2004, um Erfahrungen mit diesem neuartigen Instrument sammeln zu k\u00f6nnen. Im Rahmen einer Begleitforschung, die das IAB in Auftrag gegeben hat, werden Implementation und Wirksamkeit des Vermittlungsgutscheins, aber auch weiterer Instrumente (Beauftragungen Dritter nach \u00a7 37 SGB III, Personalserviceagenturen (PSA)) evaluiert. Gegenstand des hier vorgestellten Teiles des ersten Zwischenberichtes vom Dezember 2003 waren Untersuchungen zur Implementationsphase der Vermittlungsgutscheine, erste Strukturinformationen und Einsch\u00e4tzungen durch Fachund F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte in den 50 Untersuchungs-Agenturen f\u00fcr Arbeit. Zu den VGS sollte insbesondere auch ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Einschaltung der privaten Vermittler gewonnen werden. Auf der Basis einer noch schmalen und unvollst\u00e4ndigen Datengrundlage waren zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt noch keine Aussagen zur arbeitsmarktlichen Wirkung von VGS m\u00f6glich. Der Zwischenbericht enth\u00e4lt gleichwohl eine Reihe (vorl\u00e4ufiger) quantitativer und qualitativer Befunde, die f\u00fcr Fach\u00f6ffentlichkeit und politische Akteure von Interesse sein d\u00fcrften. Es werden erste vertiefende Informationen zu den ehemals Arbeitslosen vorgestellt, die mit einem Vermittlungsgutschein \u00fcber die Einschaltung eines privaten Arbeitsvermittlers eine Arbeitsstelle gefunden haben. Auch wird der Markt der eingeschalteten privaten Arbeitsvermittler in seinen Grundz\u00fcgen transparent. Die Ergebnisse der Befragungen der Fach- und F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte aus den Arbeitsagenturen und Expertengespr\u00e4che mit ihnen verweisen auf unterschiedliche Erfahrungen mit den Vermittlungsgutscheinen und unterschiedliche Sichtweisen zur arbeitsmarktlichen Wirkung dieses Instruments aktiver Arbeitsmarktpolitik."

      "In currency exchange markets, there is a conflict between individual decisions and the socially optimal solution. Whereas agents have a coordination motive to take the same position, at the social level effective market coordination per se is not socially valuable, and the central bank aims at driving agents? actions as close as possible to the economic fundamental state. Some studies argue that it might be better to withhold public information because its potential to serve as a focal point induces agents to exaggerate the importance of public announcements. This paper shows that public information should always be provided with maximum precision, but under certain condition not to all agents. Restrictions on the degree of publicity are a better instrument with which to prevent the negative welfare effects of public announcements than restrictions on their precision are. The optimal degree of publicity is always positive."

      "Arbeitsgelegenheiten in der Entgeltvariante stehen seit Einf\u00fchrung des SGB II im Jahre 2005 als ein Instrument zur Verf\u00fcgung, mit dem die Besch\u00e4ftigungsf\u00e4higkeit arbeitsloser Bezieher von ALG II erh\u00f6ht werden soll. Im ersten Jahr wurden \u00fcber 25.000 Hilfebed\u00fcrftige durch dieses Instrument gef\u00f6rdert. Wir betrachten im vorliegenden Beitrag, wie Arbeitsgelegenheiten in der Entgeltvariante ausgestaltet sind und welche Personengruppen gef\u00f6rdert werden. Im Gegensatz zum \"Ein-Euro-Job\" sind diese Arbeitsgelegenheiten in der Regel Vollzeitstellen und unterliegen der Beitragspflicht zur Arbeitslosenversicherung. Die Teilnahme an solchen Ma\u00dfnahmen dauert h\u00e4ufig nicht l\u00e4nger als sechs Monate und nur in ganz wenigen F\u00e4llen l\u00e4nger als ein Jahr. Wir gehen insbesondere der Frage nach, ob die vorgeschriebene Nachrangigkeit von Arbeitsgelegenheiten gegen\u00fcber Arbeit, Ausbildung und anderen Ma\u00dfnahmen in einer Konzentration der F\u00f6rderung auf Problemgruppen des Arbeitsmarktes zum Ausdruck kommt. Dies ist allerdings f\u00fcr viele Gruppen mit geringen Chancen auf eine Eingliederung in den ersten Arbeitsmarkt wie \u00c4ltere nicht der Fall. Unsere Auswertungen auf der Grundlage von Personendaten der Statistik der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass einzig die Zielgruppe der Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen unter 25 Jahren besonders stark gef\u00f6rdert wird. Dabei liegt eine noch h\u00f6here Konzentration auf diese Zielgruppe vor als bei den Zusatzjobs. Dies ist m\u00f6glicherweise mit den h\u00f6heren Erwartungen an die Bruttoeingliederungserfolge zu erkl\u00e4ren."

      "Recent work criticises both the logic and relevance of the theoretical basis of the approach to estimating the costs of raising children adopted in much of the economics literature. This tends to be restricted purely to models in which the household members consume market goods with given household income. The ?costs of children? are perceived essentially as market consumption costs. This ignores the fact that an important, possibly preponderant element of child costs takes the form of parental time, which must be diverted from alternative uses such as market work, other house-hold production activities and leisure, to care for children. The studies also ignore the question of the distribution of income among adults and, in particular, the differential incidence of child costs on adult members of the household. In this paper we first of all argue that a satisfactory theoretical approach to modelling child costs must simultaneously incorporate an ?individualistic? formulation of the household (as in Apps and Rees, 1988, 99) and a formal treatment of household production (as suggested by Becker 1965, and adapted in Apps and Rees, 1988, 99). We then provide such a model. Using data from a recent Time Use Survey, we estimate specialized versions of the model for families with two children and use the results to derive the intra-family distribution of resources and implied child-rearing costs."

      "In sticky price models with endogenous investment, virtually all monetary policy rules that set a nominal interest rate in response solely to future inflation induce real indeterminacy of equilibrium. Applying the Samuelson-Farebrother conditions, we obtain a necessary and su?cient condition for local real determinacy, which reveals that increasing price stickiness or letting policy respond also to current output may help ensure a unique equilibrium. We find that the first channel by itself has a quantitatively negligible effect and almost all strict inflation-targeting rules lead to indeterminacy, whether with higher price stickiness or overall stickiness by incorporating firm-specific capital, sticky wages, or both. The effect of the second avenue depends on labor supply elasticity and stickiness. With high labor supply elasticity and price stickiness, indeterminacy is much less likely to occur as policy also responds to output. With estimated labor supply elasticity or empirically reasonable price stickiness, policy's response to output helps little in ensuring determinacy; even incorporating firm-specific capital makes only a marginal improvement. Incorporating sticky wages, on the other hand, greatly enhances the role of policy's response to output in ensuring determinacy. With both sticky wages and firm-specific capital incorporated, even a tiny response of policy to current output can render equilibrium determinate for a wide range of response of policy to future inflation."

We show that the graph in the mu-sigma[square] range is still a parabola and delineate its characteristics for altering tax rates. We presumed a risk avers investor seeking to minimize investment risks by international diversification of two uncorrelated assets. The main finding is that setting up a portfolio under the new tax condition leads to a higher transaction volume on international financial markets. In contrast, the transactions tax has got a stabilizing character when adjusting the portfolio to increased foreign investment risks."

      "Discrete-choice models provide a simple way of representing utility-maximizing labor supply decisions in the presence of highly nonlinear and possibly non-convex budget constraints. Thus, it is not surprising that they are so extensively used for ex-ante evaluation of taxbenefit reforms. The question asked in this paper is whether it is possible and desirable to get still more flexibility by relaxing some of the usual constraints imposed on household preferences and rationality. We first suggest a model which attains flexibility by making parameters vary freely across hours choices. By embedding the traditional structural approach in this specification, it is shown that the restrictions on underlying well-behaved leisure-consumption preferences are rejected. More fundamentally still, the standard approach, i.e., the assumption of unitary households optimizing statically, is strongly rejected when tested against a general model with price- and income-dependent preferences. In a static environment, the result boils down to a rejection of the unitary model. Interestingly, restrictions from both structural and standard models also imply important discrepancies in estimated elasticities and simulated predictions of responses to a tax reform. In particular, large differences appear between standard models and the general model which possibly encompasses several interpretations including dynamic aspects and intrahousehold negotiation. These findings illustrate the difficulty to conduct policy analysis in a way which reconciles the best explanatory power and a framework consistent with economic theory. The general model we suggest may provide future research with an interesting setting to test some of the dimensions of household behavior."

      "In this paper, the framework of the aggregated Beveridge curve is used to investigate the effectiveness of the job matching process using German regional labour market data. For a fixed matching technology, the Beveridge curve postulates a negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the rate of vacancies, which is efficiently estimated using spatial econometric techniques. The eigenfunction decomposition approach suggested by Griffith (2000, 2003) is the workhorse to identify spatial and non-spatial components. As the significance of the spatial pattern might vary over time, inference is conducted on the base of a spatial SUR model. Shifts of the Beveridge curve will affect its position, and time series estimates on this parameter are obtained. In contrast to findings for the US and the UK, the results provide serious indication that the degree of job mismatch has increased over the last decade. Although the outward shift of the Beveridge curve can be explained by structural factors such as the evolution of long term unemployment, it is also affected by business cycle fluctuations. The role of cyclical factors threatens the stability property of the curve. The relationship might be inappropriate to investigate policy measures directed to improve the mismatch, such as labour market reforms."

      "Germany remains Europe's largest and most diversified source of new technology, but still lags in the fastest growing areas of today's high technology. After World War II, West-German technology policy sought to rebuild the institutions which had supported Germany's leadership in the high-tech industries of the early twentieth century - automobiles, machinery, electrical engineering, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Increasingly, however, those institutions are seen as failing to respond to new technological stimuli. In addition, Germany's bank-centered capital and inflexible labor markets have long constrained the opportunities of innovative firms for equity-based growth and the incentives for academic brains to set up in private business. Promising changes in technology policy and capital market conditions can be observed only since the mid-1990s."

      "Zheng has recently proposed a seller-optimal auction for (asymmetric) independentprivate- value environments where inter-bidder resale is possible. Zheng's construction requires novel conditions on the bidders' value distribution profile. We clarify the restrictions implied by these conditions. Given distributions for two bidders and the supports of the other bidders' distributions, Zheng's conditions uniquely determine the entire distribution profile. Moreover, if the bidders' distributions have the same support then Zheng's conditions imply that all distributions except one are identical, so that the final allocation is obtained after a single resale transaction, regardless of the number of bidders."

We test the hypothesis that integrated railways realize economies of scope and, thus, produce railway services with a higher level of efficiency. To determine whether joint or separate production is more efficient, we apply a Data Envelopment Analysis super-efficiency bootstrapping model which relates the efficiency for integrated production to a reference set consisting of separated firms which use a different production technology. We find that for a majority of European railways economies of scope exist."

      "A common perception about the neoclassical growth model is that an economy devoid of capital cannot evolve to strictly positive levels of output if capital is essential. We challenge this view by positing a broad class of production functions, encompassing the neoclassical production function, that'surprisingly'show that a take-off is possible even though the initial capital stock is zero and capital is essential. Since the marginal product of capital is initially infinite, the ?trivial? steady state becomes so unstable that the solution to the equation of motion involves the possibility of a take-off. When it happens, the take-off is spontaneous: there is no causality, not even randomness."

Moreover, while much is known about 19th century black legal and material conditions, less is known about how 19th century institutional arrangements were related to black stature. Although modern blacks and whites reach similar terminal statures when brought to maturity under optimal biological conditions, 19th century African-American statures were consistently shorter than whites, indicating a uniquely 19th century phenomenon may have inhibited black stature growth. It is geography and insolation that present the most striking attribute for 19th century black stature, and greater insolation and higher slave prices are documented here to be associated with taller black statures."

      "Empirical research on the determinants of international migration including the LDCs has so far neglected one important issue: the complex relationship of development and migration. Since the beginning of the 1990s several arguments have been discussed which hint at the possibility that progress in development of less developed regions might lead to more migration, even if income differentials to the potential destination regions decrease. This paper presents these arguments and tests them for the case of migration to Germany from 86 Asian and African countries from 1981 to 1995. The results confirm the importance of dissolving financial restrictions on migration, migration networks, and changes in the societal structure of the sending countries as well as the existence of a home preference. It is shown, however, that population growth does not necessarily lead to more international migration. The estimations also control for the political situation in the home countries and for institutional measures in the host country."

      "Weakening bargaining power of unions and the increasing integration of the world economy may affect the volatility of capital and labor incomes. This paper documents and explains changes in income volatility. Using a theoretical framework which builds distribution risk into a real business cycle model, hypotheses on the determinants of the relative volatility of capital and labor are derived. The model is tested using industry-level data. The data cover 11 industrialized countries, 22 manufacturing and services industries, and a maximum of 35 years. The paper has four main findings. First, the unconditional volatility of labor and capital incomes has declined, reflecting the decline in macroeconomic volatility. Second, the idiosyncratic component of income volatility has hardly changed over time. Third, crosssectional heterogeneity in the evolution of relative income volatilities is substantial. If anything, the labor incomes of high- and low-skilled workers have become more volatile in relative terms. Fourth, income volatility is related to variables measuring the bargaining power of workers. Trade openness has no significant impact."

Using a stochastic frontier panel data model that controls for unobserved heterogeneity a multiple-output multipleinput distance function model is estimated in order to evaluate the sources of productivity growth: technological progress, technical efficiency change and scale effects. The results indicate that technology improvements were by far the most important driver of productivity growth, followed by gains in technical efficiency, and to a lesser extent by exploitation of scale economies. Overall, we find an average productivity growth of 39 per cent within the sample period."

To this end, we set up a small-scale macroeconomic model of a dual economy to capture the transmission mechanisms through which the deregulation of product and factor markets, the liberalization of the trade and FDI regime, and the privatization of public companies impact on the distribution of employment and wages between the formal and the informal sector. We empirically test the implications of our theoretical model in a detailed case study on the structural reform process in Bolivia since 1985."

      "Das heutige System der sozialen Mindestsicherung verhindert in Deutschland die Ausbildung eines Niedriglohnsektors. Dies ist eine wesentliche Ursache f\u00fcr die hohe Arbeitslosigkeit Geringqualifizierter. Dieser Beitrag stellt zwei h\u00e4ufig genannte Ma\u00dfnahmen zur \u00dcberwindung sozialstaatlicher Besch\u00e4ftigungsschwellen einander gegen\u00fcber. Am Beispiel eines aktuellen, symptomorientierten Vorschlags f\u00fcr Lohnsubventionen durch Absenkung der Arbeitnehmerbeitr\u00e4ge zur Sozialversicherung auf niedrige Einkommen wird gezeigt, dass F\u00f6rderung kleiner Markteinkommen durch Kombil\u00f6hne die Erwerbsbeteiligung nur unwesentlich erh\u00f6ht. Zugleich k\u00f6nnen Mitnahmeeffekte entstehen, mit denen unerw\u00fcnschte Arbeitszeitwirkungen und hohe fiskalische Kosten verbunden sind. Ein alternativer, ursachenorientierter Ansatz ist die Senkung des sozialen Leistungsniveaus durch Workfare. Eine Absch\u00e4tzung des Einkommenspotenzials von Transferbeziehern auf Grundlage des Sozio-\u00f6konomischen Panels veranschaulicht, dass sich mit der Verpflichtung erwerbsf\u00e4higer Sozialhilfeempf\u00e4nger zu sozial n\u00fctzlicher Arbeit bei unver\u00e4ndertem Niveau der sozialen Mindestsicherung deutlich positive Besch\u00e4ftigungseffekte erzielen lassen.",
      "The German system of generous subsistence payments to the unemployed generates disincentives for labor supply, preventing employment at low wages. This creates substantial unemployment of the low-skilled. This paper discusses the quantitative effects of two frequent proposals to overcome the work barriers set up by the welfare state. Using a recent concept of raising in-work income through cutting social insurance contributions at low earnings as an example, we illustrate that wage subsidies have negligible impact on labor force participation. In addition, the policy might have costly side effects, as it creates parttime incentives beyond the target group of the low qualified. As an alternative, we assess the labor market impact of a workfare strategy. The potential wages of transfer recipients, estimated on the basis of the German Socio-Economic Panel, suggest that combining social transfers with the obligation to work could substantially improve labor market performance of the employable low-skilled."

In each of two stages, a risk-neutral agent can choose an unobservable effort level. A success in the first stage makes e.ort in the second stage more effective. Should one agent be in control in both stages (integration), or should different agents be in charge of the two actions (separation)? Both modes of organization can be explained on the basis of incentive considerations due to moral hazard, without resorting to commitment problems or ad hoc restrictions on the class of feasible contracts."

      "The existing literature on the comparison of tournaments and piece rates as alternative incentive schemes has focused on the case of unlimited liability. However, in practice real workers' wealth is typically restricted. Therefore, this paper compares both schemes under the assumption of limited liability. The results show that if the cost function is suffciently convex, first-best effort will be more likely implemented under piece rates than under tournaments. Moreover, if first-best implementation is not achieved and workers earn positive rents, efforts and profits will be larger for piece rates than for tournaments given suffciently convex costs. While tournaments offer a partial insurance due to their fixed prizes, piece rates may not work any longer if potential losses become prohibitively high. Finally, if risk is suffciently high, piece rates will dominate tournaments despite the partial insurance effect of tournament compensation. Since effort costs and risk may depend on an individual worker's characteristics, on the characteristics of his job and on his hierarchical position, these findings have important implications for the choice of incentive schemes and the allocation of workers in firms"

      "Although there is a host of literature on the locational choice of traditional economy firms, relatively little is known about the locational needs and preferences of new economy firms. Therefore, the current paper provides an empirical analysis of the factors determining the regional distribution of new economy firms in Germany. Using a count data analysis, we find evidence that the number of firms listed in a particular region depends positively on the region's knowledge potential (as measured by the number of patents or by the number of R&D employees) as well as on the regional supply of venture capital."

      "Using data from the first eleven waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel this study investigates the dynamic effects of health shocks on employment and economic wellbeing of older workers. A health shock trebles the probability of leaving the labor force and almost doubles the unemployment risk. The financial effects of health shocks are small on average and those individuals with the highest remaining earnings potential are least affected by the health shock. Welfare state instruments support the poorest section of the population but do not succeed in neutralizing the effects of a health shock for these groups."

Special permission was granted to link regional data to individual respondents in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Results of a bivariate probit model correcting for sample selection show that high regional unemployment discourages women from entering the labor market. Further, findings indicate that women with young children are willing to work, but that women with young children and mothers who are unhappy with the regional childcare provision are the least likely to look for a job. These findings indicate that high institutional and spatial barriers discourage mothers from entering employment."

      "The difference between the potential net wage income and the social welfare payments is measured for different types of private households in Germany. In 2001, the difference is small for households consisting of at least three persons. For three types of households the difference is calculated for the 1962\u20132001 period; it turns out that it decreased significantly. The (explicit and implicit) marginal tax rates for wage income of the recipients of social assistance are extremely high (up to 100 percent). Thus, the incentives to work are strongly impaired. The downward adjustment of wages for low skilled workers was impeded by the system of social assistance. As a consequence, unemployment increased.",
      "Der Abstand zwischen dem potentiellen Nettoarbeitseinkommen und dem Sozialhilfeanspruch (Lohnabstand) wird f\u00fcr verschiedene Haushaltstypen gemessen. Er ist im Jahr 2001 f\u00fcr Haushalte, die aus drei oder mehr Personen bestehen, gering. Der Lohnabstand hat in den vergangenen 40 Jahren abgenommen. Die marginale Belastung des Arbeitseinkommens von Sozialhilfeempf\u00e4ngern ist extrem hoch; sie betr\u00e4gt in bestimmten Einkommensbereichen 100 Prozent. Die Arbeitsanreize f\u00fcr Sozialhilfeempf\u00e4nger werden daher betr\u00e4chtlich beeintr\u00e4chtigt. Das Sozialhilfesystem hat die marktgerechte Anpassung der L\u00f6hne von Personen mit einer geringen Qualifikation behindert und zum Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit beigetragen."

      "This paper presents new evidence on how the annuitization decision is affected by changes in the annuity's value. We take advantage of an unprecendented change in policy, which in 2004 moderated the super-mandatory Swiss occupational pension scheme: The 20 percent reduction in the rate at which retirement capital is translated into a life-long annuity equates to a net present value loss of approximately 20'000 SFR (20'000 USD) for the average retiree. Using administrative data and correcting for anticipation effects, we show that due to the change in policy there was an approximately 8 percentage point change in the share of men choosing to annuitize their savings. We also show that the estimated responsiveness of the cash-out decision to variations in a utility based measure for the annuity value is comparable to results of previous studies, which employed completely different sources of variation in the annuity's value."

      "We examine the effect of single motherhood on children's secondary school track choice using a sample of 14 years old children drawn from the German Socio-Economic Panel. In line with previous studies for the U.S., the U.K. and Sweden, we find a negative correlation between disrupted family structure and children's educational outcome. Looking for alternative explanations for this correlation, we use ordered probit regression models to control for factors related to single motherhood such as lower educational background, lower household income and higher labor supply of the mother. Our evidence suggests that single parenthood reduces school attainment mainly because it is associated with lower resources (income and time) available for the child."

      "Estimating labor supply functions using a discrete rather than a continuous specification has become increasingly popular in recent years. On basis of the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) I test which specification of discrete choice is the appropriate model for estimating labor supply: the standard conditional logit model or the random coefficient model. To the extent that effect heterogeneity is present in empirical models of labor supply functions, the application of a random coefficient model is necessary to avoid biased estimates. However, because of the complex structure, random coefficient models defy calculating confidence intervals of marginal effects or elasticities. Therefore, if heterogeneity is nonexistent or does not lead to a significant bias in the derived labor supply elasticities, standard discrete choice models provide the more favorable choice. Due to their simple structure, conditional logit models are far less computational intensive providing standard tools to calculate confidence intervals of elasticities. My findings suggest that effect heterogeneity is present when estimating a discrete choice model of labor supply drawing on data of the GSOEP. However, the labor supply elastisities derived form the specifications with and without random effects do not differ significantly. That leads to the conclusion that the standard discrete choice model, attractive for its simple structure, provides an adequate model choice for the analysis of labor supply functions based on the GSOEP."

      "Integrierte Versorgung ist einer der Schlagbegriffe, die momentan die gesundheitspolitische Debatte in Deutschland bewegen. In den letzten zwei Jahren wurden bereits \u00fcber 2.000 verschiedene Vertr\u00e4ge zwischen Krankenh\u00e4usern, \u00c4rzten und Krankenkassen geschlossen, \u00fcber die 4 Millionen Versicherte und ein Verg\u00fctungsvolumen von ca. 500 Millionen Euro betroffen sind. \u00dcber die Struktur dieser Vertr\u00e4ge sowie die Erfahrungen der Beteiligten sowohl auf Seiten der Krankenkassen, der \u00c4rzte und der Patienten gibt es bis dato keine umfangreichen empirischen Erkenntnisse. Die vorliegende Arbeit versucht dieses Informationsdefizit zumindest f\u00fcr den Bereich der Erfahrungen von beteiligten \u00c4rzten und Krankenkassen ein wenig zu reduzieren. Hierf\u00fcr wurde eine kleine Erhebung in Niedersachsen durchgef\u00fchrt, um \u00fcber ein Stimmungsbild der Akteure, Erkenntnisse f\u00fcr eine zuk\u00fcnftige Ausrichtung der integrierten Versorgung zu sammeln.",
      "Integrated health care is one of the major issues in German health care policy at this moment. This is due to recent changes in social security law, which now allows for direct contracts between providers and statutory health insurances. The changes were enacted in January 2004 and thus far over 2,000 contracts between hospitals, physicians and health insurances have been reported. Over 4 million patients and nearly half a billion Euros in fees are affected by that change. Little work has been done in Germany so far in evaluating those contracts. In addition, there is merely no information on the experiences from physicians, patients or health administrators. The paper looks empirically on a sample from physicians and health administrators, who were being asked via a standardized questionnaire on their thoughts now that two years under the new system have gone by."

The paper looks at the long-run reasons for this loss of economic dynamics besides German unification: These include leaving labor idle, a declining share of investment in GDP, a weaker innovative activity, an ineffective system for human capital formation with the exception of vocational training and an erosion of the export position with a reduced attractiveness for foreign direct investment. The issue is raised whether Germany belongs to a new category of economies, the NDCs, the Newly Declining Countries."

      "In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of employment determination in four transition economies as they move from central planning to a market economy in the early 1990s. We use firm level panel data sets from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to estimate dynamic employment equations for the period immediately before and after the start of transition. We find evidence that firms behave for the most part as if they were on their labor demand curves, with little evidence of labor hoarding. There were significant cross-country variations in the determinants of employment during the reform process however. Hungarian and Polish firms started the transition already substantially reformed, and became even more responsive to market signals as transition proceeded. In contrast, firms in the Czech and Slovak republics started in the completely unresponsive mode characteristic of central planning, but rapidly caught up with their counterparts in Hungary and Poland."

      "This paper analyzes the migration behavior of ethnic groups in the former Soviet Un-ion (FSU) from 1989 to 1999. The two main migration movements have been return migration of ethnic groups to their titular nation and migration of all ethnic groups to the Russian Federation. Using factor analysis, we are able to disentangle the effects of economic wealth, growth, and political reforms on migration behavior. Ethnic sorting is found to be the major determinant of migration, which can explain both return migration and migration to Russia. The emigration behavior of Jews and ethnic Germans is found to be very similar to the migration behavior of ethnic groups migrating within the FSU."

      "Foreign direct investment - the major driving force of globalization - is increasingly dominated by merger and acquisition activities. Since the mid-1990s, an unprecedented wave of foreign direct investment and a corresponding wave of cross-border mergers and acquisitions can be observed. As a result, the structure of firms and of entire industries is fundamentally reshaped. The degree of horizontal integration has been increased, whereas vertical integration has been reduced. Transborder investments are basically motivated by the exploitation of economies of scale from headquarter services, which are of rising importance in the transition towards the New Economy.",
      "Internationale Direktinvestitionen, die als entscheidender Motor der Globalisie\u00adrung gelten, werden mehr und mehr durch Fusionsaktivit\u00e4ten dominiert. Seit Mitte der neunziger Jahre ist eine ausgepr\u00e4gte Welle von Direktinvestitionen und eine entsprechende Welle grenz\u00fcberschreitender Fusionen zu verzeichnen. Im Zuge dieser Welle werden weitreichende Strukturver\u00e4nderungen innerhalb einzelner Firmen als auch in ganzen Industrien vollzogen. Die horizontale Integration wird ausgebaut, w\u00e4hrend zugleich das Ausma\u00df der vertikalen Inegration reduziert wird. Derartige Umstrukturierungen, bei deren Umsetzung internationale Investitionen eine zentrale Rolle spielen, sind stark motiviert durch das Ausnutzen von Skalenertr\u00e4gen bei Headquarter Services, die durch das Vordringen der Neuen \u00d6konomie fortw\u00e4hrend an Bedeutung gewinnen."

      "Empirical evidence from the U.S. and the European Union suggests that regions which contribute to interregional redistribution face weaker borrowing constraints than regions which benefit from interregional redistribution. This paper presents an argument in favor of such differentiated budgetary institutions. It develops a two-period model of a federation consisting of two types of regions. The federal government redistributes from one type of regions (contributors) to the other type (recipients). It is shown that a fiscal constitution with lax budget rules for contributors and strict budget rules for recipients solves the self-selection problem the federal government faces in the presence of asymmetric information regarding exogenous characteristics of the regions."

      "This paper shows that monitoring too much a partner in the initial phase of a relationship may not be optimal if the goal is to determine his loyalty to the match and if the cost of ending the relationship increases over time. The intuition is simple: by monitoring too much we learn less on how the partner will behave when he is not monitored. Only by giving to the partner the possibility to misbehave he might be tempted to do it, and only in this case there is a chance to learn his type at a time where separation would be possible at a relatively low cost."

      "Conventional theory holds that moral hazard - the additional health care purchased as a result of becoming insured - is an opportunistic price response and is welfare-decreasing because the value of the additional health care purchased is less than its costs. The theory of the demand for health insurance presented here suggests that moral hazard is primarily an income transfer effect. In an estimation based on parameters from the literature, the value of moral hazard consumption is found to be 3 times greater than its costs, suggesting that income transfer effects dominate price effects and that moral hazard is welfare-increasing."

      "This paper surveys the empirical literature on the association between growth on inequality in less developed countries, with a particular emphasis on labor market inequality. Crosscountry studies failed to find a clear link from growth to inequality. Country-specific studies that focused on labor market inequality have shown that, with a few exceptions, wage inequality increases with growth. The paper argues that the methodologies used in many of the empirical applications, designed to investigate changes in labor market inequality in developed economies, should be adjusted to account for the unique properties of labor markets in LDCs."

      "The costs of vertical integration are analyzed within a game-theoretic signaling model. It is shown that a company when being vertically integrated with a supplier may well decide to buy certain components from this supplier even at a lower quality than that offered by external sources. When the parent company decides to stop buying components from the integrated supplier, the value of the ownership share in the supplier is reduced: On the one hand, the supplier?s profit from the transactions with its parent is foregone. But on the other hand, other clients may decide against buying from this supplier as the latter?s reputation for providing an appropriate quality is damaged. The loss in value of the ownership share may outweigh the loss due to the lower quality. The anticipation of this effect leads to reduced ex ante incentives for the supplier?s management to raise quality. A spin-off may therefore be beneficial as it strengthens incentives. Costs and benefits of vertical integration are analyzed and consequences for vertically integrated companies organized in profit centers are discussed."

      "The standard situation of ex post information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders is extended by risk aversion and heterogenous levels of reservation utility of lenders. In a situation of direct contracting optimal incentive compatible contracts are valuable for both, borrowers and lenders. However, there may appear credit rationing as a consequence of borrowers optimal decision making. Introducing a bank into the market increases total wealth due to the appearance of a portfolio effect in the sense of first order stochastic dominance. It can be shown that this effect may even reduce the problem of credit rationing provided it is su?ciently strong."

      "The recent decline in the Federal Reserve's check volumes has received a lot of attention. Although switching to electronic payments methods and electronic checkprocessing has been credited for much of that decline, some of it could be caused by changes following bank mergers involving Federal Reserve customer banks. This paper evaluates the effect of bank mergers on Federal Reserve check-processing volumes. Using inflow-outflow and regression methods, we find that mergers between two or more Reserve Bank customers have resulted in volume losses, especially during the first quarter following the merger. On average, the estimated cumulative loss of volume during the first five post-merger quarters was 2.6 million checks. While the overall number of checks in the United States has declined during the past few years, the Federal Reserve has lost additional check-processing volume because of bank mergers."

      "This paper attempts to add to the understanding of the causes for the differing recent developments in inequality in OECD countries. The similarity of shocks and technological changes affecting these countries suggests that interactions of these shocks and countryspecific institutions are responsible for the diverging inequality patterns. The paper suggests a channel complementary to those investigated in recent contributions, focusing on the impact of education. A microfoundation of human capital formation is proposed, emphasizing heterogeneity of individuals and multidimensionality of human capital. The reactions in individual behavior triggered by technological change are crucially affected by the education system and are shown to be responsible for the divergent developments in inequality."

We estimate a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System, and find that, whilst most commodities are normal goods, sweets and toys are luxury items for children. Children of lone parents have lower budget shares for expenditure on soft drinks, leisure, personal goods and books/magazines, but higher budget shares for expenditure on sweets and vice products (alcohol, cigarettes and gambling). Having a working mother increases child expenditure on food products and toys. A higher parental budget share, on any given commodity, is generally associated with an increased child budget share suggesting that children mimic their parent?s expenditure patterns."

      "This paper investigates the macroeconomic effects of job creation schemes and vocational training on the matching processes in West Germany. The empirical analysis is based on regional data for local employment office districts for the period from 1999 to 2003. The empirical model relies on a dynamic version of a matching function augmented by ALMP. In order to obtain consistent estimates in the presence of a dynamic panel data model, a firstdifferences GMM estimator and a transformed maximum likelihood estimator are applied. Furthermore the paper considers the endogeneity problem of the policy measures. The results obtained from our estimates indicate that vocational training does not significantly affect the matching process and that job creation schemes have a negative effect."

      "This paper uses individual level data to analyze the effect of changes in the compulsory benefit package of the German statutory health insurance scheme on the demand for private supplementary insurance. In particular, we aim at measuring the effect of excluding dentures from the benefit package in 1997 as well as the effect of re-including them in 1999. A difference-in-differences estimator is used. Individuals born prior to 1979 serve as control group because only the young were affected by the reform. Our results do not exhibit any significant effects on the demand for supplementary health insurance. Thus, the hypothesis that clients do make informed choices about their health insurances' coverage is not supported."

      "It is widely accepted that China has been experiencing an export-led growth approach. However, the question whether government can reshape industry structure through production subsidies to enhance export performance has not been answered. This paper analyses the impact of production subsidies on firms' export performance using a very comprehensive and recent firm level database and controlling for the endogeneity of subsidies. It documents robust evidence that production subsidies stimulate export activity, although this effect is conditional on firm characteristics. In particular, the beneficial impact of subsidies is found to be more pronounced amongst profit-making firms, firms in capital intensive industries and those located in non-coastal regions. Compared to firm characteristics, the extent of heterogeneity across ownership structure (SOEs, collectives and privately-owned firms) proves to be relatively less important."

      "Building on a new data set which is combined from national micro-data bases, we highlight differences in the structure of migrants to four countries, viz. France, Germany, the UK and the US, which receive a substantial share of all immigrants to the OECD world. Looking at immigrants by source countries, we illustrate the important role of distance, both geographical and cultural, immigration policies and migrant networks. Differentiating immigrants by their educational attainments, we observe interesting patterns in the skill composition, employment opportunities and wages for migrants to the different destination countries. Focusing on migration between the four countries in our data set, we find that migration within Western Europe is small and rather balanced in terms of skill structures, while there appears to be a brain drain from Europe to the US."

      "The re-analysis of statistical data is an effective means of protecting the public from undiscovered errors in social science research. Re-analysis is critical, as there is no difference between official data and non-official data. However, discussions concerning data protection legislation do not usually take this into consideration. Proper data protection rules must make it possible to conduct independent re-analysis of protected data. The paper discusses the possibilities of self-binding in the (international) scientific community and creating a new kind of law which would provide scientific data with a special legal status (Forschungsdaten-Geheimnis).",
      "In den Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaften besteht ohne die Moeglichkeit einer Re-Analyse von statistischen Ergebnissen (gleicherma\u00dfen amtlichen wie nicht-amtlichen) die Gefahr von nicht entdeckten Irrtuemern. Mit anderen Worten: Re-Analysen sind in der Wissenschaft die \"Berufungsinstanz\", ohne die es keine funktionierende Scientific Community geben kann. Der Schutz vor fehlerhaften wissenschaftlichen Ergebnissen mit Hilfe von Re-Analysen ist ein \"oeffentliches Interesse\", das in der Datenschutzdiskussion und insbesondere bei der Auslegung von Datenschutzregelungen bislang zu wenig beachtet wurde. Das Wissenschaftssystem und der Gesetzgeber sind gleicherma\u00dfen aufgefordert, Re-Analysen zu ermoeglichen ohne den Datenschutz zu verletzen. Als Instrumente werden Selbstbindungen im Wissenschaftssystem und die Schaffung eines gesetzlichen \"Forschungsdaten-Geheimnisses\" diskutiert."

      "Between 1990/91 and 2000/01 the number of male undergraduates in Britain increased by over one-third while the number of female undergraduates has increased nearly twofold. Given this substantial increase in supply we would expect some impact on the wage premium for recent graduates unless demand has shifted in parallel. Following Katz and Murphy (1992), we adopt a simple supply and demand framework to analyse changes in earnings mark-ups across degree disciplines over time. Using a propensity score approach to match those graduates entering the labor market with an age balanced sample of individuals with two or more A-Levels from the Labour Force Survey, we find a significant decline in the markup for females, whilst no such change is apparent for males. These aggregate figures, however, mask a great deal of variation across degree subjects, with declines in those subjects in which women predominate and in the lowest quartile of the earnings distribution being identified. The results point to both supply and demand factors impacting on the graduate mark-up as theory would suggest."

      "We answer the questions, how many firms acting in the modern German biotechnology industry are funded by venture capital companies (VCC) as well as equity funded by corporate investors. The theory suggests a high relevance of VCC as venturing partner of high-tech projects. In addition we argue that corporate investors are a venturing partner of firms with high-risk projects to a lower extent. Incumbents,however, are confronted with some opportunities in the low-risk area of the biotechnology industry to secure an optimal supply for the current product pipeline.Our empirical results emphasize a crucial importance of venture capital as financial resource for high-risk projects: whereas 42 percent of all healthcare developer in the early stage are venture-backed firms, only a small share of low-risk projects received venture capital. The results for corporate investors are reversible.Fewer high-tech projects and more low-risk projects compared to VCC are equity financed by corporate investors. The econometric analysis suggests that the observed pattern is mainly driven by the level of project risk and hence, supports all our hypotheses."

      "The natural sciences have established a general scaling law that relates metabolism and body size of animals. Recently this association - known as Kleiber's law - has received deep theoretical foundation by network theory and has been fruitfully applied to explain various biological phenomena, in particular ontogenetic growth. Here we derive a similar power law for economic metabolism (energy consumption per capita) and economic size (capital per capita). Invoking the power law we provide a metabolic-energetic founded law of motion for capital per capita. Using data for the U.S. states we test the resulting structural model and find evidence in favor of a scaling parameter, between energy and capital per capita, of about 2/3."

      "We study the subsidization of extra jobs in a general equilibrium framework. While the previous literature focuses on symmetric marginal employment subsidies where firms are rewarded when they increase employment but punished when they reduce their workforce, we consider an asymmetric scheme that only rewards employment expansion. This changes the incidence substantially. In the asymmetric case without punishment, it becomes less costly for firms to lay off a substantial fraction of their workforce when trade unions raise wages. This tames the unions, which causes wage moderation and raises aggregate employment and welfare. For moderate subsidy rates, all unions prefer to restrain their wage claims. At sufficiently high subsidy rates, labor market conditions improve so much that some unions enforce higher wages and let their firms shrink. This displacement of firms might have a negative impact on employment and welfare."

      "This paper examines the post-War Summer and Winter Olympic Games in order to determine the economic and political determinants of national participation, of female participation in particular, and of success at the Games (i.e., medal counts). Compared to the Summer Games, Winter participation levels are driven more by income and less by population, have less host nation bias and a greater effect of climate. Roughly similar factors determine medal count success, although single party and communist regimes win far more medals (and gold medals) in both seasons than can be attributed to other factors. We find no large significant differences between types of athletic events (e.g. luge versus nordic skiing). We estimate that major participating nations requires a $260 rise in income per capita to send an extra participant. Similarly the \"cost\" of an extra medal is $1700 per capita and $4750 per capita for an additional gold medal. Predictions for participation and medal counts (including gold medals in particular) for the 2002 Salt Lake City Games are presented as a test of our analysis."

      "We investigate whether a government should lead an activist policy in a rigorous utility maximizing framework under rational expectations. The economy is a monetary one with preset wages, and is subject to both demand and supply shocks. It is assumed that the government can never act on the basis of information superior to that of the private sector. Morecover wages are set after monetary injections have been carried out. We find that the optimal policy is nevertheless an activist countercyclical one. It has the remarkable property that, although the economy is hit each period by stochastic shocks after wages have been preset, this optimal policy will nevertheless succeed in keeping the economy on a full employment track."

      "The pattern of employment among men and women has changed remarkably over the past decades. While the employment rate of women has risen, that of men has continued to decline. Disproportionate growth in the participation in the labor market of women with highincome husbands has heightened concerns that wives? earnings may increase income inequality among married couples. Questions about the implications for income distribution have also been raised, especially in countries like Italy, the UK, and the US, where more noticeable growth of income inequality during the last decade has accompanied changes in employment levels. In this paper we attempt to measure the impact of the changes of women and men?s employment patterns on the distribution of income among Italian households. Using microdata from the Historical Archive of the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), a repeated cross-sectional survey that covers the period 1977-1998, we examine the impact of employment changes on inequality in family income distribution and how this relationship has changed over time and across regions. Our preliminary results show that the increase in the employment of women during the period of observation had the effect of reducing inequality in family incomes, while the decline in men's employment had the opposite effect. The equalizing impact of wives' work on income inequality has become increasingly important over time and has been greater among Northern households. Especially since the mid-nineties, wives' earnings have reduced inequality in as much as the distribution of income would have been less equal in their absence. More conclusive results could be achieved by analyzing a more structural approach where the labor supply of husbands and that of wives are determined simultaneously."

      "The main focus of this paper is on the examination of the role and importance of innovation networks in the decision to found a firm and after entry to the market has taken place. For newly-founded firms from business sectors with high innovation intensity, the implications resulting from the involvement of ?start-ups? in a network of innovation are more closely analyzed. The examinations show, on the one hand, that contact to innovation networks has a positive effect on the decision-making behaviour of those wishing to found a firm. The empirical analysis, on the other hand, underline the fact that membership of a network plays an important role after entry to the market has taken place. By exploiting external resources, ?start-ups? can expand internally available R&D capacities and reduce (financial) restrictions on resource provision. This makes it possible to a notable extent to realize synergy effects and learn strategies for the commercial exploitation of innovation efforts. Finally, multivariate estimations show that network membership has a statistically highly significant effect - measured by turnover or the development of the number of employees - on the growth and market success of newly-founded firms."

      "Using a nationally-representative panel data set of U.S. high school students (AddHealth data) that contains a relatively large sample of siblings and twins, the paper investigates the impacts of gun availability at home and individual drug use on robbery, burglary, theft and damaging property for juveniles. Using a variety of fixed-effects models that exploit variations over time and between siblings and twins, the results show that gun availability at home increases the propensity to commit crime by about two percentage points for juveniles but has no impact on damaging property. The results indicate that it is unlikely that gun availability is merely a measure of the unobserved home environment because gun availability does not influence other risky or bad behaviors of juveniles such as smoking, drinking and fighting, being expelled from school, lying, and having sex. No support is found for the hypothesis that gun availability decreases the propensity for being victimized. In fact, the results show that having access to guns increases the probability of being cut or stabbed by someone and of someone pulling a knife or gun on the juvenile. Estimates obtained from models that exploit variations over time and between siblings and twins indicate that drug use has a significant impact on the propensity to commit crime. We find that the median impact of cocaine use on the propensity to commit various types of crimes is 11 percentage points. The impact of using inhalants or other drugs is an increase in the propensity to commit crime by 7 and 6 percentage points, respectively."

      "This paper analyzes, within a regional growth model, the impact of productive governmental policy and integration on the spatial distribution of economic activity. Integration is understood as enhancing territorial cooperation between the regions, and it describes the extent to which one region may benefit from the other region's public input, e.g. the extent to which regional road networks are connected. Both integration and the characteristics of the public input crucially affect whether agglomeration arises and if so to which extent economic activity is concentrated: As a consequence of enhanced integration, agglomeration is less likely to arise and concentration will be lower. Relative congestion reinforces agglomeration, thereby increasing equilibrium concentration. Due to the congestion externalities, the market outcome ends up in suboptimally high concentration."

      "Die aktuelle Diskussion um die Novellierung der deutschen Pressefusionskontrolle macht deutlich, welche Relevanz medien\u00f6konomische Fragestellungen haben. Was jedoch bei dieser Diskussion h\u00e4ufig vernachl\u00e4ssigt wird, ist die intensive Betrachtung der \u00f6konomischen Besonderheiten von Medienm\u00e4rkten, n\u00e4mlich der Verbundenheit von Anzeigen- und Publikumsmarkt, die Existenz von Kostendegressionen und eine unterschiedliche Marktmacht von Printmedien auf dem Anzeigen- und Publikumsmarkt. Diese Arbeit analysiert diese Charakteristika und deren Wirkungen bei m\u00f6glichen Unternehmenszusammenschl\u00fcssen. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass aufgrund der Heterogenit\u00e4t der einzelnen M\u00e4rkte eine intensivere Einzelfallbetrachtung und eine st\u00e4rkere \u00d6konomisierung der Fusionskontrolle sinnvoll erscheint. Grundlage dieser \u00d6konomisierung k\u00f6nnen quantitative Analysen sein, die mithilfe vorhandener Marktdaten durchgef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen."

      "This paper is a review of the recent advances in the measurement of inequality. Inequality can have several dimensions. Economists are mostly concerned with the income and consumption dimensions of inequality. Several inequality indices including the most widely used index of inequality namely the Gini coefficient is discussed. Non-income inequality includes inequality in skills, education, opportunities, happiness, health, wealth, and others. The direct and indirect effects of inequality in non-income factors on earnings and health are discussed. Results from review of the literature suggest relationship between inequality in income and non-income dimensions. This indicates that one should account for the interrelationship between the different dimensions in the measurement and analyses of inequalities."

      "This paper shows that subsidy competition may be efficiency enhancing. We model a subsidy game among two asymmetric regions in a new trade model, where capital can freely move among regions, but capital rewards are repatriated. We study subsidy competition, starting from an equilibrium where the industry core is inefficiently locked in to the smaller region. When regions weigh workers' and capitalists' welfare equally, the core region will set its subsidy low enough that the industry relocates to the larger region, restoring an efficient allocation. When workers' welfare is weighted more heavily, the core may pay subsidies that are high enough to prevent a relocation of industry."

Our model encompass both bureaucratic delegation from a government to a privatization agency and electoral delegation from voters to a government. We identify two powerfull effects of delegation when contracts are incomplete: The incentive effect increases the incentive part of service providers' remuneration and we show that strategic delegation may substitute formal incentive contracts. The bargaining effect improves the bargaining position vis a vis a private firm with market power and leads to a lower price for the service."

      "Between 1991 and 1997 West Germany spent on average about 3.6 bn Euro per year on public sector sponsored training programmes for the unemployed. We base our empirical analysis on a new administrative data base that plausibly allows for selectivity correction by microeconometric matching methods. We identify the effects of different types of training programmes over a horizon of more than seven years. Using bias corrected weighted multiple neighbours matching we find that all programmes have negative effects in the short run and positive effects over a horizon of about four years. However, for substantive training programmes with duration of about two years gains in employment probabilities of more than 10% points appear to be sustainable, but come at the price of large negative lock-in effects."

In the framework of a new open economy macro-model, we show that the link between financial openness and business cycle volatility depends on the nature of the underlying shock. Empirical evidence supports this conclusion. Our results also show that the link between business cycle volatility and financial openness has not been stable over time."

      "This paper models a multilateral agreement on investment (MAI) as a coordination device. Multinational enterprises can invest in any number of countries. Without a multilateral investment agreement, expropriation triggers an investment stop by the single MNE. Under a multilateral agreement, expropriation leads to a joint reaction by all MNEs. Switching to such a regime increases worldwide FDI and raises the world interest rate. Distinguishing three groups of countries, we show that industrialized countries experience an outflow of capital but benefit overall due to an increase in repatriated profits. Middle income countries are likely to gain from increased inward FDI, whereas least developed countries lose because they receive less FDI. Our results explain the stylized fact that a multilateral investment agreement was opposed by least developed nations and certain groups in rich countries."

To control for measurement error in occupation and industry coding, we develop a method that utilizes the newly released, by the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Retrospective Occupation-Industry Supplemental Data Files. We emphasize the importance of the findings for understanding a number of issues in macro and labor economics, including changes in wage inequality, productivity, life-cycle earnings profiles, job stability and job security."

      "Demographic change in industrial countries will influence educational spending in potentially two ways. On the one hand, the decline in the number of school-age children should alleviate the financial pressure. On the other hand, the theoretical/empirical literature has established that the concomitantly increasing proportion of elderly in the population can influence the propensity of politicians to spend on education. Using a panel of the Swiss Cantons for the period from 1990 to 2002, we find that the education system has exhibited little elasticity in adjusting to changes in the school-age population, and that the share of the elderly population has a significantly negative influence on the willingness to spend on public education."

      "This paper analyzes the effects of fiscal policy in an open economy. We extend the saversspenders theory of Mankiw (2000) to a small open economy with endogenous labor supply. We first show how the Dornbusch (1983) consumption-based real interest rate for open economies is modified when labor supply is endogenous. We then turn to the effects of fiscal policy when there are both savers and spenders. With this heterogeneity taken into account, tax cuts have a short-run contractionary effect on domestic production, and increased public spending has a short-run expansionary effect. Although consistent with recent empirical work, this result contrasts with those of most other theoretical models. Transitory changes in demand have permanent real effects in our model, and we discuss the implications for real exchange-rate dynamics. We also show how ?rational? savers may magnify or dampen the responses of ?irrational? spenders, and show how this is related to features of the utility functions."

      "Incentives theory suggests that compensation schemes should be analyzed along two dimensions: controllability and congruence. Most schemes cannot satisfy both criteria at once. EVA bonus schemes, a major managerial innovation of the 90's, favor the congruence criterion. This paper questions ist properties along the controllability dimension. The question is addressed through an in-depth case study: after three years in operation the actual bonuses paid by the system, as well as qualitative feedback from the managers involved, are analyzed. It is argued that EVA bonus schemes may have a major controllability problem."

      "In a sharp break with past German research, some recent estimates have suggested that plants with work councils have 25 to 30 per cent higher productivity than their works-councilfree counterparts. Such findings can only serve to buttress the strong theoretical and policy interest in the German institution, not least in an environment of union decline. In the present paper, we estimate the effects of works councils on productivity, 1997-2000, using a nationally representative German data set. We recoup the works council effect by estimating translog production functions, stochastic frontier production functions, and a model in first differences. Once we focus on a core sample of establishments with 21 to 100 employees in which the powers of the works council are a datum, it emerges that the positive productivity differential is a chimera. By the same token, neither is the effect negative. This result is important in its own right given the sharply opposing findings of past empirical research and the partisan positions these have helped sustain."

      "In this note we compare the laissez-faire steady-state solution in the Howitt and Aghion (1998) model to the social optimum. The analysis offers several new insights in comparison to the welfare analysis in Aghion and Howitt (1992). We find various new distortions between private and optimal solution. First, a monopoly distortion effect generates too little capital accumulation in the private solution because households? gross return per unit of capital will be lower than in the social optimum due to monopoly power. Second, a cost-benefit gap effect leads to excessive research in the private solution because the planner is interested in the average technology whereas the private researcher is interested in the leading edge technology. Third, we decompose the well-known intertemporal spillover effect into three subeffects and clarify why the planner uses the interest rate as discount rate."

      "This paper argues that globalization has led to a shift in developed countries from an industrial to an entrepreneurial model of production. Globalization is interpreted as a level shock in the supply of unskilled labor to the world economy, a decrease in the level of political risk associated with outward foreign direct investment (offshoring), and the widespread diffusion of a general purpose technology such as ICT. The im-pact of these exogenous shocks is then analyzed in a variety expansion model that distinguishes among three types of varieties. Following the life cycle we distinguish among new, mature and offshore production. The above shocks all result in a shift in comparative advantage in developed countries towards new varieties which corres-pond to the early stage of the product life cycle. Moreover, because entrepreneurs serve as agents that move varieties between life cycle stages, their importance in-creases due to globalization. The many new opportunities for profit benefit entrepre-neurs and skilled labor. By contrast, factors of production employed in the mature stages of the life cycle become less important. Thus, the model explains the emer-gence of what we label an entrepreneurial economy."

Most importantly, it provides evidence on the related ergodic density which suggests that this polarization may persist in the future. This past and probably future polarization is primarily related to the service sector of the regional economies and not to manufacturing industries sector."

      "In October 1999 the unemployment rate of people with severe disabilities in Germany was more than double that of the non-disabled population. To improve this situation, the People with Severe Disabilities Act was reformed to increase incentives for the severely disabled to enter the work force and for employers to hire such workers. In 2003 the Federal Government announced that through this reform it had successfully reduced the number of unemployed by 25% representing around 45,000 individuals. However, an evaluation of the impact of this policy reform on labour market outcomes for the severely disabled indicates that this was not achieved by getting these individuals into employment. Moreover, a recent deterioration in the number of unemployed suggests that the success in 2002 was at best temporary. Thus, there is no evidence that changes to financial incentives in the PSDA had a positive long-term impact on the employment of people with severe disabilities."

      "In this paper, we estimate the difference in long-run after-tax and transfer income from employment and from non-employment available in January 1998 to families in France that received the Guaranteed Minimum Income (RMI) in December 1996. Based on estimated wages we compute potential increases in disposable income (without accounting for opportunity costs such as child care or transportation). The observed wages received by welfare recipients are very low because of a high probability of part-time work, including for men. Based on the wage distribution, and supposing that the adult in the household with the highest potential earnings is the one employed, we find that 74% of welfare households would have an increase in disposable income if they were to be employed, relative to their disposable income in the absence of employment, and that the median gain would be around 198 euros per month. Very low gains are frequent however. In addition, single mothers are the group for which the fewest number of households (43%) would gain from employment. The share of households that would have in increase in income grows to 96% when we focus exclusively on couples and consider both members working. As the wage distribution used is very atypical, we build an upper bound estimate, using a representative survey of the working population in 1998. This is equivalent to assuming that RMI beneficiaries do not differ from the rest of the population in terms of their unobserved heterogeneity. The share of households that have an increase in disposable income from working goes from 74% to 89%, with the shares for single mothers still the lowest."

      "Keeping up with rapid technological change necessitates constant innovation. Successful innovation depends on both incumbent workers' knowledge, based on experience, and knowledge about the latest technologies, along with the skills needed to implement them. Both of these knowledge-based elements of innovation can be attained through moderate labor force turnover in combination with continuous training. Based on German micro data, we find empirical evidence in support of training leading to innovation within a multivariate regression framework. However, when instrumenting training by the existence of a union's contract or a works council this impact disappears."

      "The increase in wage inequality in Russia during its transition process has far exceeded the increase in wage dispersion observed in other European countries undergoing transition. Russia also has an extremely large incidence of wage arrears. We analyse to what extent wage arrears affect the wage distribution and measures of wage inequality in Russia. We present counterfactual distributions, derived from a variety of different methods, which suggest that conventional measures of earnings dispersion would be some 20 to 30 per cent lower in the absence of arrears. We then go on to show how wage gaps at various points in the pay distribution across gender, education, region and industry are influenced by a failure to allow for wage arrears. Using our counterfactual estimates we show, for example, that the median gender wage gap would be around twenty-five points higher than the actual gap that we observe. Similarly, the counterfactual ratio of mean graduate pay to mean pay of those with primary education is around twenty points lower than observed. We show that the parameters of the counterfactual wage distributions are very similar to the parameters of the observed wage distributions of those not in arrears. This means that for those wishing to study aspects of wage differentials and inequality in Russia, it may be feasible to use the subset of those not in arrears and still get close to the true population parameters."

      "Past empirical research on monetary policy in open economies has found evidence of the 'delayed overshooting', the 'forward discount' and the 'exchange rate' puzzles. We revisit the effects of monetary policy on exchange rates by applying Uhlig's (2005) identification procedure that involves sign restrictions on the impulse responses of selected variables. We impose no restrictions on the exchange rate to leave the key question as open as possible. The sign restriction methodology avoids the price puzzles of the identification strategies used by Eichenbaum-Evans (1995) and by Grilli-Roubini (1995, 1996), which are particularly pronounced, when using an updated data set. We find that the puzzles regarding the exchange rates are still there, but that the quantitative features are different. In response to US monetary policy shocks, the peak appreciation happens during the first year after the shock for the US-German and the US-UK pair, and during the first two years for the US-Japan pair. This is consirably quicker than the three-year horizon found by Eichenbaum-Evans. There is a robust forward discount puzzle implying a large risk premium. We study this issue, introducing and calculating conditional Sharpe ratios for a Bayesian investor investing in a hedged position following a US monetary policy shock. For foreign monetary policy shocks, we find more robust results than with the Grilli-Roubini recursive identification strategy: the posterior distribution regarding the exchange reaction looks rather similar across countries and VAR specifications. In particular, we find that there seems to be considerable uncertainty regarding the initial reaction of the exchange rate. Quantitatively, monetary policy shocks seem to have a minor impact on exchange rate fluctuations."

      "This paper analyses competition of moral norms and institutions in a society where a fixed share of people unconditionally complies with norms and the remaining people act selfishly. Whether a person is a norm-complier or selfish is private knowledge. A model of voting-by-feet shows that those norms and institutions arise that maximize expected utility of norm-compliers, taken into account selfish players' behavior. Such complier optimal norms lead to a simple behavioral model that, when combined with preferences for equitable outcomes, is in line with the relevant stylized facts from a wide range of economic experiments, like reciprocal behavior, costly punishment, the role of intentions, giving in dictator games and concerns for social efficiency. The paper contributes to the literature on voting-by-feet, institutional design, ethics and social preferences."

      "Politicians travel extensively abroad, for various reasons. One purpose of external visits is to improve bilateral economic relations. In this paper, I examine the effect of state visits on international trade. I use a large data set covering the travel activities of the heads of state of France, Germany and the United States between 1948 and 2003. My results indicate that state and official visits are indeed positively correlated with exports. A typical visit is associated with higher bilateral exports by about 8 to 10 percent, holding other things constant."

Using a multivariate model for the period 1999-2004 and various election indicators we find strong evidence that the Stability and Growth Pact has not restricted fiscal policy makers in the euro area in pursuing expansionary policies before elections. In an election-year \u2013 but not in the year prior to the election \u2013 the budget deficit increases. This result is in line with third generation PBC models, which are based on moral hazard. We also find a significant but small partisan effect on fiscal policy outcomes."

      "International activities of commercial banks are a potential source for the transmission of shocks across countries. In Europe, bank finance plays a relatively important role, and efforts have been made at creating a level playing field for financial institutions. This paper reviews the stylized facts of the integration of European banking markets and the changing nature of cross-border banking. Although the openness of financial systems has increased, bilateral financial linkages among EU countries remain relatively small. The exception are claims of German banks on a number of smaller countries, and we use these data for an analysis of the determinants of cross-border lending patterns."

      "This paper investigates the magnitude and the main determinants of share price reactions to buy-back announcements of German corporations. For our comprehensive sample of 224 announcements that took place between May 1998 and April 2003 we find average cumulative abnormal returns around -7.5% for the thirty days preceding the announcement and around +7.0 % for the ten days following the announcement. We regress post-announcement abnormal returns with multiple firm characteristics and provide evidence which supports the undervaluation signaling hypothesis but not the excess cash hypothesis or the tax-efficiency hypothesis. In extending prior empirical work, we also analyze price effects from initial statements of firms that they intend to seek shareholder approval for a buy-back plan. Observed cumulative abnormal returns on this initial date are in excess of 5% implying a total average price effect between 12% and 15% from implementing a buy-back plan. We conjecture that the German regulatory environment is the main reason why market variations to buy-back announcements are much stronger in Germany than in other countries and conclude that initial statements by managers to seek shareholders? approval for a buy-back plan should also be subject to legal ad-hoc disclosure requirements."

      "Empirical studies on the relationship between income and happiness commonly use standard ordered response models, the most well-known representatives being the ordered logit and the ordered probit. However, these models restrict the marginal probability effects by design, and therefore limit the analysis of distributional aspects of a change in income, that is, the study of whether the income effect depend on a person's happiness. In this paper we pinpoint the shortcomings of standard models and propose two alternatives, namely generalized threshold and sequential models. With data of two waves of the German Socio- Economic Panel, 1984 and 1997, we show that the more general models yield different marginal probability effects than standard models."

      "This paper provides a preliminary assessment of recent reforms of German employment promotion policy. While several recent studies analyze the impact of measures of employment promotion for the case of Germany, no comparable study exists on the aggregate level, thus precluding any assessment of the overall impact of such measures. The reform of 1998 recognized for the first time in the history of German employment promotion that evaluation should be an integral part of the delivery of policy interventions. Yet, while this has led to an important first step \u2013 the systematic collection of data \u2013 evaluation itself has mistakenly been understood by the legislator as a pure accounting exercise. We discuss this problem from the perspective of the recent evaluation literature in economics and statistics, thus providing a frame of reference for performing credible scientific evaluation of employment promotion policy."

      "Since financial derivatives are key instruments for risk taking as well as risk reduction, it is only straightforward to examine their role in currency crises. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the impact of currency futures trading on the underlying exchange rates. After a discussion of trading mechanisms and trader types, the linkage between futures trading activity and spot market turbulence is modelled using a VAR-GARCH approach for the exchange rates of Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea and Switzerland in terms of the US dollar. The empirical results indicate that there is a positive relationship between currency futures trading activity and spot volatility. Moreover, in the case of four out of the total of five currencies discussed in this paper, futures trading activity adds significantly to spot volatility."

      "How will international integration affect welfare policies? This paper considers the possibilities of financing public sector activities (public consumption and social security expenses) by general (wage) taxation in an economy which becomes more integrated in international product markets. Even if labour is internationally immobile, the increased mobility of products and hence jobs implies a change in the distortions arising from taxes and social security contributions levied on labour income. Since financing of social security via general taxation involves a negative externality the effects of international integration depend critically on the institutional structure of the labour market. This paper shows that increased international integration inducing more product market competition implies that it becomes more costly to maintain welfare systems financed by general taxation."

      "The risk of bad debt losses evolves for companies which grant payment targets. Possible losses have to be covered by these companies equity and liquidity reserves. The question of how to quantify the level of risk of bad debt losses will be discussed in this paper. Input values of this risk are the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default. It is shown how companies can derive probability functions to describe uncertainty and variability for each input value. Based on these probability functions a simulation model is developed to quantify the risk of bad debt losses. Based on an empirical study probability functions for probability of default and loss given default are presented."

      "Labour economists have been increasingly interested in the impact of technological change upon employment and unemployment. However, the predominant focus of empirical studies has been on employment and unemployment stocks, whereas technological change is more likely to affect the flows of labour. This paper focuses on the latter issue. In particular, given the technological change, two major questions posed in this paper are: (i) who moves from low-tech to high-tech jobs and who moves from high-tech to low-tech jobs, and (ii) what are the factors which drive such movements. The data used in this study are from the 1994 Australian Labour Mobility Survey. A new index describing the technological level of a job is constructed and the magnitude and direction of movements along the technological ladder are examined. Using individual-level socio-economic variables, we explain the determinants of the direction of the job change. Some relevant policy implications are also discussed."

In this paper the excess demand for subsidized child care slots is estimated using a partial observability model in the style of Abowd and Farber (1982). The results show that more than 50 percent of children aged 0-3 are queuing for child care slots, whereas only 10 percent of children aged 4-6 years are queuing. For children in the younger age group about 255,000 child care slots are missing. This number comes close to the government?s plan to expand subsidized child care by 230,000 slots."

We propose a novel way of testing this proposition, which exploits the variation in training incidence and in the training wage premium within the European Union. Our results unambiguously show that (general) training incidence is higher in clusters \u2013 defined by country, sector, occupation and educational attainment \u2013 with a lower training wage premium, measured as the differential between the median wage growth of trained and untrained employees."

      "In empirical research it is common practice to use sensible rules of thumb for cleaning data. Measurement error is often the justification for removing (trimming) or recoding (winsorizing) observations whose values lie outside a specified range. We consider a general measurement error process that nests many plausible models. Analytic results demonstrate that winsorizing and trimming are only solutions for a narrow class of measurement error processes. Indeed, for the measurement error processes found in most social-science data, such procedures can induce or exacerbate bias, and even inflate the variance estimates. We term this source of bias ?Iatrogenic? (or econometrician induced) error. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical results from the Census PUMS data and 2001 CPS data demonstrate the fragility of trimming and winsorizing as solutions to measurement error in the dependent variable. Even on asymptotic variance and RMSE criteria, we are unable to find generalizable justifications for commonly used cleaning procedures."

In equilibrium industries with an expanding and those with a declining employment share coexist, and each such industry goes (or has already gone) through a cycle of take-off, maturity, and stagnation. Nonetheless macroeconomic aggregates grow pari passu at a constant rate."

      "This review covers a range of measures and methods frequently employed in empirical analysis of global income inequality and global income distribution. Different determinant factors along with quantification of their impacts and empirical results from different case studies are presented. These results are further contrasted to those obtained based on the World Income Inequality Database. A number of issues crucial to the studies of global income inequality are addressed. These are the concepts, measurement and decomposition of inequality, the world distribution of income and inequality measured at different levels of aggregation: global, international and intra-national. We analyse income at each of the three levels, discuss the benefit and limitations of each approach and present empirical results found in the literature and compare it with those based on the World Income Inequality Database. Research on the world income inequality supports increased awareness of the problem, its measurement and quantification, identification of causal factors and of policy measures to affect global income inequality."

We divide old-age life into two periods with uncertain survival from the end of the first to the end of the second. We show that a rise in the survival rate causes different patterns of change in annuitization, depending on the initial survival rate. When the initial survival rate is low (high), there is full (partial) annuitization. There is thus an inverse relationship between longevity and annuitization."

      "The article examines conditions, under which the degree of democratization influences environmental policy outcomes, with a given resource endowments' heterogeneity as a crucial feature of a politico-economic process. We develop an OLG model with pollution as an aggregate externality. The decisive voter chooses redistribution contributing to abatement financing. By comparing the optimal taxation under alternative political regimes we analyze their implications for environment, efficiency and growth. We find that left regimes, choosing more progressive redistribution, maintain better environmental quality, which supports empirical research. Inequality does not appear to be harmful for the environment, and it dampens the effect of democracy imperfections on redistribution."

      "Social surveys are often used to estimate unemployment duration distributions. Survey nonresponse may then cause a bias. We study this using a unique dataset that combines survey information of individual workers with administrative records of the same workers. The latter provide information on unemployment durations and personal characteristics of all survey respondents and non-respondents. We develop a method to empirically distinguish between two explanations for a bias in results based on only survey data: (1) selectivity due to related unobserved determinants of unemployment durations and non-response, and (2) a causal effect of a job exit on non-response. The latter may occur even in fully homogeneous populations. The methodology exploits variation in the timing of the duration outcome relative to the survey moment. The results show evidence for both explanations. We discuss implications for standard methods to deal with non-response bias."

Der vorliegende Beitrag unternimmt eine Bestandsaufnahme der diesbez\u00fcglichen Diskussion. Nach einer kurzen Darstellung der Fakten wird gezeigt, dass die traditionellen Argumente \"Preiskonvergenz\" und \"Balassa-Samuelson-Effekt\" die beobachteten Inflationsunterschiede nicht hinreichend erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnen. Anhand eines neu-keynesianischen Makromodells werden strukturelle Unterschiede in den beteiligten Volkswirtschaften als Ursache f\u00fcr die Inflationsdifferenzen erl\u00e4utert. Im Einzelnen sind dies l\u00e4nderspezifische Schocks in der G\u00fcternachfrage, die asymmetrische Wirkungsweise der Euro/Dollar-Entwicklung und die asymmetrische Wirkungsweise der einheitlichen Geldpolitik."

      "Historically, in virtually all developed economies there seems to be clear evidence of an inverse relationship between female labor supply and fertility. However, particularly in the last decade or so, the relationship across countries has been positive: for example countries like Germany, Italy and Spain with the lowest fertility rates also have the lowest female participation rates. We accept the hypothesis that the reason for this lies in the combined effects of a country?s tax system and system of child support, and we have sought to clarify this theoretically, using an extended version of the Galor-Weil model. The results suggest that countries with individual rather than joint taxation, and which support families through improved availability of alternatives to domestic child care, rather than through direct child payments, are likely to have both higher female labor supply and higher fertility. These results are strengthened when we take account of the heterogeneity among households that undoubtedly exists."

      "We introduce a new method of varying the risk that bidders face in first-price private value auctions. We find that decreasing bidders' risk significantly reduces the degree of overbidding relative to the risk-neutral Bayesian-Nash equilibrium prediction. This implies that risk affects bidding behavior as generally expected in auction theory. While resolving a long-standing debate on the effect of risk on auction behavior, our results give rise to a new puzzle. As risk is diminished and overbidding decreases for most of the value range, a significant degree of underbidding sets in for very low values."

      "This paper analyzes the interaction between intergenerational wealth transmission, human capital investments under uninsurable labor income risk, and economic growth in a small open overlapping-generations economy with heterogeneous agents. It demonstrates how the role of the personal income distribution for an economy?s process of development through risky human capital accumulation depends on the shape of the saving function. Consistent with recent empirical evidence, the analysis suggests that the impact of higher inequality on the aggregate human capital stock, and thus, on growth may be positive. This result rests on two features of the model, which both are largely supported by empirical evidence. First, as shown under weak conditions, children?s human capital investments are positively affected by parents? income. Second, the marginal propensity to save is increasing in income."

      "This paper contrasts the modern use of the assumption that rationality guides individual economic behaviour, as reflected in simple models of utility and profit maximization, to literature between 1890 and 1930 which sharply challenged the use of such an assumption, as well as to later literature in economic psychology from Herbert Simon onwards which sees economic (and other) cognitive processes in different ways. Some of the earlier literature proposed objective and operational notions of rationality based on the availability of information, ability to reason (cognitive skills), and even morality. Learning played a major role in individuals achieving what was referred to as complete rationality. I draw on these ideas, and suggest that developing models in which economic agents have degrees (or levels) of economic cognition which are endogenously determined could both change the perceptions economists have on policy matters and incorporate findings from recent economic psychology literature. This would remove the issue of whether economic agents are dichotomously rational or irrational, and instead introduce continuous metrics of cognition into economic thinking. Such an approach also poses the two policy issues of whether raising levels of economic cognition should be an objective of policy and whether policy interventions motivated by departures from full economic cognition should be analyzed."

      "The relationship between per capita income and a number of pollution indicators has been found to display an inverted U-shaped or downward-sloping pattern. Corruption may affect this relationship in two distinct ways: by raising pollution at given income levels (direct effect) and by reducing per capita income (indirect effect). The total effect is ambiguous a priori. Using cross section data for several indicators of pollution, the paper estimates the direct and the indirect effect of corruption on pollution. The indirect effect via income is positive or negative depending on the income level. If negative, the indirect effect is dominated by the positive direct effect. Overall, our measures of pollution are monotonically increasing in corruption. Because this relationship is particularly strong at low income levels, developing countries can considerably improve both their economic and environmental performance by reducing corruption."

      "Based on the Ramsey equation and an ethically motivated rejection of pure utility time discount, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change concentrates on the use of the elasticity of marginal utility \u00e7 in the intergenerational social welfare function. We support this position by showing that, also from the view point of sustainability, application of \u00e7 is preferable to the use of the pure time discount parameter \u00f1 when a balanced distribution of utility across generations is to be brought about. After reviewing empirical studies on the size of \u00e7 we develop a novel axiomatic approach based on non envy criteria by which we obtain values for \u00e7 lying in a range between 1 and 2. Whereas the starting point of the Stern Review quite explicitly is an ethical one, many critics of the Review deny this ethical stance and thus - as described in our paper - miss a crucial element of the Stern Review"

      "The ad valorem versus unit taxes debate has traditionally emphasized tax yield. For this criterion, ad valorem taxes outperform unit taxes in terms of welfare for a wide range of imperfect competition settings, including Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition. Yet, in a number of policy fields, such as environmental, health or trade economics, policy makers apply taxes to target the production/consumption volume in an industry, i.e. aim at a certain corrective effect rather than tax yield. This paper compares the two tax instruments with respect to equal corrective-effect in a Dixit-Stiglitz setting with love of variety, entry, exit, and redistribution of tax revenues. We find that unit taxes lead to more firms in the industry, less output per firm, less tax revenue, but higher welfare compared to ad valorem taxes."

Under the consideration of the inherent costs related to the loss of privacy, the paper analyzes the incentives of insureds to reveal information, whereby they can decide how much or what quality of information to reveal. It is also allowed for the possibility that high risk individuals might mimic low risk individuals. The resulting market equilibrium is characterized and it is shown, that it will never be optimal for insureds to reject the monitoring technology and that under certain conditions, which are specified in the paper, it will be optimal for them to reveal complete information. Concerning the welfare effects both low risk and high risk individuals will always be better off. Unless it is optimal for individuals to reveal complete information, an all-ornothing nature of the monitoring technology will not be efficient."

For a large economy with private informa- tion about individual preferences, the two approaches are shown to be equivalent if and only if, in addition to incentive compatibility and par- ticipation constraints, the final allocation of private-good consumption and admission tickets to public goods satisfies a condition of renegoti- ation proofness. Without this condition, a mechanism involving mixed bundling, i.e. combination tickets at a discount, is superior."

      "This paper characterises rules-based fiscal policy setting. Basically, we translate a standard monetary policy rule into a simple fiscal policy rule. We then infer on fiscal policymakers' reaction coefficients by testing the rule with GMM. Interaction is also tested directly by the inclusion of monetary policy setting. Our results qualify existing evidence on systematic fiscal policy in two respects. First, fiscal policy usually stabilises public debt. And there is indeed substantial interaction between fiscal and monetary policy via the debt channel. Second, sustainability is achieved with a 'stop-go? cycle of consolidation. Consolidation does not come at the cost of less cyclical stabilisation unless debt ratios are high."

      "Married women in the United States are increasingly integral to their families' economic wellbeing. With two-earner families becoming the norm, little research investigates the role of wives in family income mobility. How much does a wife's labor market activity matter in her family's ability to gain or hold its place in the income distribution of all families? Are women's contributions to mobility weaker when children are present? Do more-educated wives make bigger contributions than wives with less education? Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to observe families at the beginning and end of three 10- year periods spanning the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, we find that married-couple families moving up the income distribution saw larger increases in wives' employment, annual work hours, and earnings than downwardly mobile married couples. These data confirm the popular perception that families needed to work more hours to move ahead or hold their own in the income distribution. In upwardly mobile families, wives' work hours increased substantially, while husbands' hours increased only modestly. Wives with children living at home were less likely to work and averaged fewer work hours; however, wives in upwardly mobile families with children increased their work hours more than those in upwardly mobile families without children. Less-educated wives' earnings gains were critically important to their families' advancement. Moreeducated wives also helped their families move up, but their contributions were surpassed by the earnings gains of their husbands."

      "This paper provides a hedonic price analysis of mobile telephones for the German market. We have assembled data on 302 different handsets from 25 manufacturers over the period from May 1998 to November 2003. While volume has a negative effect on the price of a mobile handset, the number of ringtones and the talk time battery life relative to the handset?s weight positively affect mobile phone prices. Maybe somewhat surprisingly, radiation is statistically not significant. Also handsets have become cheaper over time, and handsets with additional features, such as MMS, MP3 or Bluetooth, command a higher price. In addition, we found positive brand name effects for LG, Nokia, Motorola and Samsung, but not for Siemens or Sony. According to our estimations these brand name premiums may range from 57 to 172 Euros."

      "In a global context foreign direct investment (FDI) and migration substitute one another in the matching process between workers and firms. However, as labor flows can lead to the formation of business networks, migration can actually facilitate FDI in the long-run. We first present a stylized model for a small open economy illustrating these offsetting effects. We then use U.S. data on bilateral labor inflows and capital outflows to measure the extent of contemporaneous substitutability and dynamic complementarity between migration and FDI. We find that brain drain and FDI inflows are negatively correlated contemporaneously but that skilled migration is associated with future increases in FDI inflows. We also find suggestive evidence of substitutability between current migration and FDI for migrants with secondary education, and of complementarity between past migration and FDI for unskilled migrants."

      "Eastern Germany's recovery from the unification shock has been characterized by deep structural change - with apparent repercussions for the West as well - and an integration process involving both capital deepening (extensive and intensive investment) and labor thinning (net out-migration). I propose a constant-returns neoclassical model of economic integration which can account for these facts. Adjustment costs determine dynamics and steady state regional distribution of production factors. The model also explains persistent wage and capital rate-of-return differentials along the equilibrium path. Under competitive conditions, observed factor price differentials contain information on those adjustment costs."

It turns out that the identification problem in the decomposition equation is a disguised identification problem of constant and dummy variables in a regression equation. This paper proposes a simple and natural remedy for this problem by utilizing ?normalized? regressions which enable us to identify the constant and estimates of each dummy variable. The identification problem is automatically resolved once we obtain ?normalized? regression equations for two comparison groups."

      "In this paper we investigate trade union formation. To this end we apply a model with two types of labour where the interests of both groups of labourers are represented by either a joint (industry) labour union or by two independent group-specific (professional) labour unions. We investigate whether, and if so, under which conditions, it is beneficial for at least one group of labourers to form its own independent union; or whether it is in the interest of both groups to have a joint industry labour union. Applying the (asymmetric) Nash bargaining solution, we find that under reasonable conditions, it is beneficial for at least one group of labourers to form its own independent labour union. In this case a joint union must be considered as an unstable institution. The profit share, however, is always higher if the firm bargains with a joint labour union. This explains why employers vehemently oppose recent split offs of specialized labour groups from existing industry unions and from tariff unions."

      "Using unique recently released nationally representative high-quality data at the plant level, this paper presents the first comprehensive evidence on the relationship bet-ween productivity and size of the export market for Germany, a leading actor on the world market for manufactured goods. It documents that firms that export to countries inside the euro-zone are more productive than firms that sell their products in Ger-many only, but less productive than firms that export to countries outside the euro-zone, too. This is in line with the hypothesis that export markets outside the euro-zone have higher entry costs that can only by paid by more productive firms."

      "In 1999, eleven European countries formed the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU); they abandoned their national currencies and adopted a new common currency, the euro. Several recent papers argue that the introduction of the euro has led (by itself) to a sizable and statistically significant increase in trade between the member countries of EMU. In this paper, we put the trade effect of the euro in historical perspective. We argue that the creation of the EMU was a continuation (or culmination) of a series of previous policy changes that have led over the last five decades to greater economic integration among the countries that now constitute EMU. Using a data set that includes 22 industrial countries from 1948 to 2003, we find strong evidence of a gradual increase in trade intensity between European countries. Once we control for this trend in trade integration, the euro's impact on trade disappears. Moreover, a significant part of the trend in European trade integration is explained by measurable policy changes."

      "Anglo-Saxon countries have been successful in the 1990s concerning labor market performance compared to the former role models Germany and Japan. This reversal in relative economic performance might be related to idiosyncracies in financial markets with bank-based financial markets as in Germany and Japan being possibly inferior to stockmarket based financial markets in turbulent times and when approaching the economic frontier. A cleavage is related to venture capital markets which are flourishing on Anglo- Saxon but not on German type financial markets. Venture capital is crucial for financing structural change, new firms and innovations and therefore possibly also nowadays for employment growth."

      "The passage of Title IX, the 1972 Education Amendments to the Civil Rights Act, expanded high school athletic opportunities to include girls, revolutionizing mass sports participation in the United States. This paper analyzes high school athletic participation in the United States and how sports offerings for boys and girls changed subsequent to the passage of this legislation. Girls' sports participation rose dramatically both following the enactment of Title IX and subsequent to enhancements to its enforcement. Approximately half of all girls currently participate in sports during high school; however, there remains a substantial gap between girls and boys participation in many states. States' average education level and social attitudes regarding Title IX and women's rights are correlated with this remaining gender gap. Examining individual high school students, sports participation is seen more frequently among those with a privileged background: white students with married, wealthy, educated parents are more likely to play sports. This finding points to an overlooked fact - while Title IX benefited girls by increasing the opportunity to play sports, these benefits were disproportionately reaped by those at the top of the income distribution."

      "Group liability is often portrayed as the key innovation that led to the explosion of the microcredit movement, which grew with the Grameen Bank in the 1970s and continues on today with hundreds of institutions around the world. Group liability claims to improve repayment rates and lower transaction costs when lending to the poor by providing incentives for peers to screen, monitor and enforce each other's loans. However, some argue that group liability creates excessive pressure and discourages good clients from borrowing, jeopardizing both growth and sustainability. Therefore, it remains unclear whether group liability improves the lender's overall profitability and the poor's access to financial markets. We worked with a bank in the Philippines to conduct a field experiment to examine these issues. Working with 169 previously formed group liability centers of approximately twenty women, we converted half to individual-liability centers (treatment) and kept the other half as-is with group liability (control). The weekly group meetings still occurred; only the group liability is removed. After one year, we find no increase in default and we find higher outreach due to more new clients joining the treatment groups."

      "This paper yields a rationale for why subsidized public banks may be desirable from a regional perspective in a financially integrated economy. We present a model with credit rationing and heterogeneous regions in which public banks prevent a capital drain from poorer to richer regions by subsidizing local depositors, for example, through a public guarantee. Under some conditions, cooperative banks can perform the same function without any subsidization; however, they may be crowded out by public banks. We also discuss the impact of the political structure on the emergence of public banks in a political-economy setting and the role of interregional mobility."

      "Using data from the March Current Population Surveys in the United States, the Household Panel Survey in Great Britain and the Socio-Economic Panel in Germany we find gains from economic growth in the United States over their 1990s business cycle (1989-2000) were more equitably distributed than were the gains over their 1980s business cycle (1979-1989). Furthermore, they were more equitably distributed than were the gains in Germany over their 1990s business cycle (1991-2001). However, gains from economic growth in Great Britain over their 1990s business cycle (1990-2000) were the most equitably distributed. Our results hold using both summary measures of inequality as well as kernel density estimations. In the United States and Great Britain the entire income distribution moved upward in the 1990s. In Germany, as was the case in the United States over their 1980s business cycle, there was a drop in the middle of the income distribution and increases in both tails. In the United States, younger persons (aged 64 and younger) fared better than older persons (aged 65 and older) while the opposite was the case in Great Britain and Germany. Income inequality fell in all three countries among the older population. But it rose in Germany, remained about the same in the United States and fell in Great Britain among their younger populations."

      "In this paper, we analyze the performance of call centers of financial service providers with two levels of support and a time-dependent overflow mechanism. Waiting calls from the front-office queue flow over to the back office, if a waiting-time limit is reached and at least one back-office agent is available. The analysis of such a system with time-dependent overflow is reduced to the analysis of a continuous-time Markov chain with state-dependent overflow probabilities. To approximate the system with time-dependent overflow, some waiting-based performance measures are modified. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of this Markovian performance approximation for different parameter settings. A sensitivity analysis shows the impact of the waiting-time limit and the dependence of the performance measures on the arrival rate."

We find that both, investment horizons and feedback frequency contribute almost equally to the effects of MLA. Longer investment horizons and less frequent feedback lead to higher investments. However, when given the choice, subjects prefer on average shorter investment horizons and more frequent feedback. Exploiting the status quo bias by setting a long investment horizon or low feedback frequency as a default turns out to be a successful behavioural intervention that increases investment levels."

      "Atypical work, or alternative work arrangements in U.S. parlance, has long been criticized for providing poorly-compensated employment. Although one group of atypical workers (contractors) seems to enjoy a wage premium, our cross-section results from the CPS and NLSY for the better-known category of temporary workers point to a negative wage differential of some 7-12 percent. It emerges that much of the latter disparity stems from unobserved worker heterogeneity (accounting for which supports a wage advantage for contracting work). Turning to fringes, the appearance in cross section of a potentially large deficit in atypical worker health benefits is again reduced after accounting for permanent unobserved individual heterogeneity. But on this occasion the reduction is very modest. Further, there is now some indication that the wage advantage of contract workers partly compensates for their reduced access to such benefits."

      "Discounted utilitarianism treats generations unequally and leads to seemingly unappealing consequences in some models of economic growth. Instead, this paper presents and applies sustainable discounted utilitarianism (SDU). SDU respects the interests of future generations and resolves intergenerational conflicts by imposing on discounted utilitarianism that the evaluation be insensitive to the interests of the present generation if the present is better off than the future. An SDU social welfare function always exists. We provide a convenient sufficient condition to identify SDU optima and apply SDU to two well-known models of economic growth. We also investigate the axiomatic basis for SDU."

      "In this paper we present an international cross-country benchmarking analysis for utility regulation of France and Germany, the two largest electricity distribution countries in Europe. We examine the relative performance of 99 French and 77 German distribution companies operating within two different market structures. This paper applies several parametric benchmarking approaches to assess the relative technical efficiency of the utilities, such as deterministic Corrected Ordinary Least Squares (COLS) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Our base model uses the number of employees as a proxy for labor and network length as a proxy for capital as inputs. Units sold and the numbers of customers are considered as outputs. Our model variations and extensions analyze the effect of different characteristics of distribution areas (e.g. population density and the choice of investment in underground cable network). We find that utilities operating in urban areas feature higher efficiency scores and that investment in underground cables increase the technical efficiency of the distribution utilities."

      "This article tests experimentally whether a high degree of collusion on advertisement expenditures facilitate tacit price collusion in duopoly markets. Two environments are tested, in which the size of the spillover between advertising expenditures is varied. The results show that the competitiveness of advertising and prices are significantly higher when the advertising spillover is higher than the price spillover than when advertising spillover is lower than the price spillover. In the second environment, a higher degree of advertising collusion leads for experienced players to a higher degree of price collusion. In the first environment, players behave at most semi-collusively, that is, if at all, they collude on advertising, but compete over prices."

      "This paper proposes a new approach for analyzing the relationship between macroeconomic factors and the income distribution. The conventional method of analysis is regression of summary inequality indices on variables such as the unemployment and inflation rates. Building on the lessons from recent advances in time-series econometrics, we suggest instead that one should first fit a parametric functional form to the income distribution for each year, and then model the time series of model parameters in terms of the macroeconomic factors. Inferences about the relationship between the income distribution and macroeconomic factors can be derived from the model estimates. We apply these methods to data from the United Kingdom for 1961-91, and contrast the results with those found using earlier methods."

      "In this paper, we tackle the issue of locating a public facility which provides a public good in a closed and populated territory. This facility generates differentiated benefits to neighborhoods depending on their distance from it. In the case of a Nimby facility, the smaller is the distance, the lower is the individual benefit. The opposite is true in the case of an anti-Nimby facility. We first characterize the optimal location which would be chosen by a social planner. Then we introduce a common-agency lobbying game, where agents attempt to influence the location and provision decisions by the government. Some interesting results arise in the case where only a subset of neighborhoods lobby. First, the solution of the lobbying game can replicate the optimal solution. Second, under-provision and over-provision of the public good may be obtained both in the Nimby and the anti-Nimby cases. The provision outcome depends on the presence of either a congestion effect or an agglomeration effect. Third, some non-lobbying neighborhoods may be better off than in the case where all neighborhoods lobby, which raises the possibility of free-riding at the lobbying stage."

      "We examine the determinants of low income transitions using first-order Markov models that control for initial conditions effects (those found to be poor in the base year may be a non-random sample) and for attrition (panel retention may also be non-random). Our econometric model is a form of endogeneous switching regression, and is fitted using simulated maximum likelihood methods. The estimates, derived from British panel data for the 1990s, indicate that there is substantial genuine state dependence in poverty. We also provide estimates of low income transition rates and lengths of poverty and non-poverty spells for persons of different types."

      "Academic contributions on the demutualization of stock exchanges so far have been predominantly devoted to social welfare issues, whereas there is scarce empirical literature referring to the impact of a governance change on the exchange itself. While there is consensus that the case for demutualization is predominantly driven by the need to improve the exchange's competitiveness in a changing business environment, it remains unclear how different governance regimes actually affect stock exchange performance. Some authors propose that a public listing is the best suited governance arrangement to improve an exchange's competitiveness. By employing a panel data set of 28 stock exchanges for the years 1999-2003 we seek to shed light on this topic by comparing the efficiency and productivity of exchanges with differing governance arrangements. For this purpose we calculate in a first step individual efficiency and productivity values via DEA. In a second step we regress the derived values against variables that - amongst others - map the institutional arrangement of the exchanges in order to determine efficiency and productivity differences between (1) mutuals (2) demutualized but customer-owned exchanges and (3) publicly listed and thus at least partly outsider-owned exchanges. We find evidence that demutualized exchanges exhibit higher technical efficiency than mutuals. However, they perform relatively poor as far as productivity growth is concerned. Furthermore, we find no evidence that publicly listed exchanges possess higher efficiency and productivity values than demutualized exchanges with a customer-dominated structure. We conclude that the merits of outside ownership lie possibly in other areas such as solving conflicts of interest between too heterogeneous members."

Im Zentrum des Berichts stehen die Entwicklung des Ma\u00dfnahmeneinsatzes und die vergleichende Untersuchung der Teilnehmerstrukturen. Bisher wurden vor allem f\u00fcnf Instrumente des SGB III zur Arbeitsf\u00f6rderung erwerbsf\u00e4higer Hilfebed\u00fcrftiger genutzt: Trainingsma\u00dfnahmen, die Beauftragung Dritter mit der Vermittlung, Eingliederungszusch\u00fcsse, Arbeitsbeschaffungsma\u00dfnahmen sowie die F\u00f6rderung der beruflichen Weiterbildung. Der Vergleich der Teilnehmerstrukturen mit dem Arbeitslosenbestand zeigt: Frauen sind in den Ma\u00dfnahmen teilweise unterrepr\u00e4sentiert. In Ostdeutschland ist der Ma\u00dfnahmeneinsatz meist intensiver als in Westdeutschland. Jugendliche werden gem\u00e4\u00df der gesetzlichen Vorgabe \u00fcberproportional h\u00e4ufig gef\u00f6rdert. Nur bei einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen stehen \u00c4ltere, Ausl\u00e4nder oder Geringqualifizierte im Mittelpunkt der F\u00f6rderung. Die Ergebnisse stehen allerdings unter dem Vorbehalt, dass Daten der kommunalen Tr\u00e4ger noch nicht vollst\u00e4ndig in die Statistiken der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit eingegangen sind. Denn die unterschiedlichen Verfahren der Datenerfassung m\u00fcssen erst noch integriert werden."

The second hypothesis tests how these attitudes are affected by the beneficial/detrimental effect of immigration on the individual and constitutes the paper?s central contribution to the literature.

      "Das Forschungs-Informations-System ist ein am Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Verkehr, Bau- und Wohnungswesen angesiedeltes neues Verfahren zur webbasierten wissenschaftlichen Politikberatung. Basis des Systems sind so genannte Wissenslandkarten, durch die verschiedene Themen struktu-riert dargestellt werden. An diesen sind kurze so genannte Synthesebe-richte angegliedert. Dort werden Forschungsergebnisse zu aktuellen politi-schen Fragestellungen im Arbeitsbereich des Bundesverkehrsministeriums, zu dem auch der Aufbau Ost geh\u00f6rt, von 16 (dezentral agierenden) fach-spezifischen Forschungsinstituten zusammengetragen, aufbereitet und in aller K\u00fcrze nutzerfreundlich zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt. Durch einfache Navi-gation innerhalb der Themen und des Systems werden so konkrete Frage-stellungen teils \u00fcberblicksartig, teils vertieft beantwortet. Wissenschaftli-che Erkenntnisse werden f\u00fcr den Nutzer und damit den politischen Ent-scheidungsprozess schnell und \u00fcbersichtlich verf\u00fcgbar gemacht. Das Institut f\u00fcr Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung bearbeitet den Bereich \"Arbeitsmarkt- und Sozialpolitik\" mit speziellem Fokus auf Fragestellungen zum Aufbau Ost. Dabei werden vor allem ost-west-spezifische Vergleichs-studien in den Mittelpunkt des Interesses ger\u00fcckt. Neben den aktuellen gesetzlichen Neuerungen und deren Auswirkungen auf die Besch\u00e4ftigungs-f\u00f6rderung in Ost- und West-Deutschland (Hartz-Gesetzgebung) werden u. a. die Wirkung arbeitsmarktpolitischer Ma\u00dfnahmen (z. B. die neuesten Erkenntnisse zum Arbeitslosengeld II) auf den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt sowie die demografische Entwicklung und deren Auswirkungen auf Ren-ten-, Gesundheits- und Familienpolitik er\u00f6rtert."

      "This paper re-examines the validity of the Phillips-Curve framework using US data. We make three main innovations. First, we introduce into the well-known Calvo price staggering framework, a regime-dependent price-changing signal. This means that a state-dependent linearization is no longer required to derive the Phillips relationship and thus that questions of regime dependency can be addressed. Second, we engage on a careful modeling of long-run supply in the economy, which permits more data-coherent measures of output gaps and real marginal costs indicators consistent with underlying, frictionless supply. Finally, we include two types of labor adjustment costs reflecting the intensive and extensive participation decisions. As regards the latter, we introduce the concept of ?effective? working hours into the production technology which generates an overtime function directly into the mark-up equation. This, it turns, out has first-order implications for the cyclicality and econometric fit of the mark-up implied by the Phillips-curve representation."

      "Although there is growing evidence on the role of agglomeration economies in the formation and growth of firms, both the concepts of agglomeration economies and entrepreneurship tend to be ambiguously defined and measured in the literature. In this study, we aim to improve the conceptualisations and measures of agglomeration economies and entrepreneurship. Indicators of agglomeration economies are analysed in clearly defined urban regimes on three spatial scales in the Netherlands \u2013 national zoning, labour market connectedness, and urban size. This is done in order to uncover their effect on two entrepreneurial phases in the firm life cycle - new firm formation and the growth of incumbent firms in the relatively new ICT industry in the Netherlands. In comparison with new firm formation, the growth of incumbent firms is not so much related to spatial clustering of the ICT industry and other localized sources of knowledge economies associated with urban density. Instead, knowledge as an input for growth of incumbent firms is associated with more endogenous (firm internal) learning aspects, reflected by a significant correlate with R&D-investments. Also the effect of local ICT firm competition differs between the two types of firms: a positive effect on new firm formation, but a negative effect on incumbent firm growth. In general, agglomeration economies have stronger effects on the formation of ICT firms than on the growth of ICT firms."

      "We present a model of optimal government policy when policy choices may exacerbate socio-political instability (SPI). We show that optimal policy that takes into account SPI transforms a standard concave growth model into a model with both a poverty trap and endogenous growth. The resulting equilibrium dynamics inherit the properties of government policies and need not be monotone. Indeed, for a broad set of conditions we demonstrate that government policy is unable to eliminate the poverty trap; when these conditions do not hold, \"most\" countries eventually reach a balanced growth path. The predictions of the model are tested by developing three new measures of SPI for a panel of 58 countries. Estimating optimal policies and the growth equation derived from the model reveals strong support for the theory. In particular, we show via simulations that optimal funding for public investment and the police cause a typical developing economy to expand on a quasi-linear growth path, with the baseline level of SPI determining whether growth is positive or negative."

      "In this paper, we study the dynamic interdependencies between high-frequency volatility, liquidity demand as well as trading costs in an electronic limit order book market. Using data from the Australian Stock Exchange we model 1-min squared mid-quote returns, average trade sizes, number of trades and average (excess) trading costs per time interval in terms of a four-dimensional multiplicative error model. The latter is augmented to account also for zero observations. We find evidence for significant contemporaneous relationships and dynamic interdependencies between the individual variables. Liquidity is causal for future volatility but not vice versa. Furthermore, trade sizes are negatively driven by past trading intensities and trading costs. Finally, excess trading costs mainly depend on their own history."

      "The German banking market is notorious for its low degree of market penetration by foreign financial institutions, suggesting that markets serviced by domestic and foreign banks are segmented. This paper employs a number of tests to determine whether activities of domestic and foreign banks are related. Using data for the years 1986-1999, we fail to find evidence for similarities in the activities of domestic and foreign banks. This holds across the two types of domestic banks (large and savings banks) and across four different activities (loans and deposits of banks and non-banks) considered."

In fact, considering the properties of various outsourcing indices and applying a panel data estimation of the effects on the within industries? wage gap in Germany, theory and empirics can be reconciled: while the wage gap increases in the aggregate, the service sector and the high skill intensive industries, it decreases in the low skill intensive industries \u2013 which is in line with theoretical findings by Arndt (1997, 1998)."

      "Since the start of European monetary union, the macroeconomic situation in Germany can in many respects only be analyzed in combination with the situation in the rest of the euro area. To take this into account, a small macroeconometric model is constructed that models the euro area as consisting of two regions, Germany and the rest of the euro area. The rest of the world is treated as exogenous. Given problems with modelling the relevant relationships in a standard vector autoregression approach, the model is set up as a dynamic simultaneous equations model. The model is used to study the impact of monetary policy or of exchange rate changes on economic activity in Germany and the euro area."

      "Many leading methodologists have described the central role that Milton Friedman''s 1953 essay (henceforth referred to as F53) has played in methodological discussions. (See for instance Daniel Hammond, 1998; Kevin Hoover; 2001; Roger Backhouse 2002.) However, it does not necessarily follow that it has had a great influence on the practice of economics, because practicing economists pay little attention to free-standing discussions of methodology; at best they learn their methodology by seeing it put to work on substantive problems.1 Arguably, Friedman and Schwartz''s (1963) A Monetary History of the United States, has had more influence on the methodology of practicing economist than did F53. The most pervasive methodological influence in macroeconomics in the last thirty years has been the insistence of new classical economists on reducing macroeconomics to microeconomics, and in this they paid no attention to philosophical debates about reductionism"

      "This study evaluates the economic effects of corporate tax coordination in the enlarged European Union using a computable general equilibrium model and a comprehensive set of scenarios for both a common corporate EU tax base and for full harmonisation of tax bases and tax rates. Our main findings are as follows: (i) Corporate tax coordination can yield modest aggregate welfare gains, but the details of the coordination policies determine outcomes and economic gains cannot be taken for granted. (ii) All scenarios for coordination leave some EU Member States as winners and others as losers. An agreement on tax coordination is therefore likely to require elaborate compensation mechanisms. (iii) The large and diverse country effects suggest that Enhanced Cooperation for a subset of the Member States may be the most likely route towards tax coordination. Coordination among a subset of relatively homogenous Member States will lead to less radical policy changes, but also to smaller gains. (iv) Identifying winners and losers from coordination for the purpose of a compensation mechanism may be problematic, since countries experiencing gains in GDP and welfare tend to lose tax revenues, and vice versa."

      "This paper analyses the causes of the precipitous fall in trade among the twelve CIS countries since 1990; points out the implications for industrial restructuring; and discusses the policy options for regional reintegration. The main finding is that the decline in intra-C!S trade was initiated by the institutional void left by the collapse of the central planning system. However, the high volume of trade among the former Soviet republics reflected largely their isolation from the rest of the world economy, as well as other policy-induced distortions. Therefore, if market-oriented economic reforms in the CIS countries are successful, intra-CIS trade flows will remain substantially smaller than during the Soviet period."

      "The relationship between competition and performance-related pay has been analyzed in single-principal-single-agent models. While this approach yields good predictions for managerial pay schemes, the predictions fail to apply for employees at lower tiers of a firm's hierarchy. In this paper, a principal-multi-agent model of incentive pay is developed which makes it possible to analyze the effect of changes in the competitiveness of markets on lower tier incentive payment schemes. The results explain why the payment schemes of agents located at low and mid tiers are less sensitive to changes in competition when aggregated firm data is used."

      "In the present note an effort will be made for a contribution to economic theory by extending the discussion paper Entrepreneurship, Regional Development and Job Creation: The Case of Portugal by R. Baptista, V. Escarta and P. Madruga, MPI, # 0605, in which the authors conclude (among others) that entrepreneurship creates jobs and reduces unemployment. This extension will be feasible by estimating the total economy's entrepreneurship reward for Western European countries and relating it with the total economy's unemployment rate. A regression based on the estimation of total economy's entrepreneurship reward will yield the same main results with the above article not only for Portugal but also for all Western European countries, that in any Western European country entrepreneurship creates enough jobs to reduce unemployment. This generalization with panel data econometric analysis is based on the discussion paper A Practical Method to Measure Entrepreneurship's Reward: A Note by M. N. Georgiou, MPI, #3805."

      "An empirical analysis of various waves of the ALLBUS social survey shows that union density fell substantially in western Germany from 1980 to 2004 and in eastern Germany from 1992 to 2004. Such a negative trend can be observed for men and women and for different groups of the workforce. Regression estimates indicate that the probability of union membership is related to a number of personal and occupational variables such as age, public sector employment and being a blue collar worker (significant in western Germany only). A decomposition analysis shows that differences in union density over time and between eastern and western Germany to a large degree cannot be explained by differences in the characteristics of employees. Contrary to wide-spread perceptions, changes in the composition of the workforce seem to have played a minor role in the fall in union density in western and eastern Germany."

      "In this paper we exploit the longitudinal element of the 1990 and 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Surveys for Britain to investigate the effect of unionism on establishment closings. Contrary to both recent U.S. research and British work using information from the earlier workplace surveys, we find a robust positive association between two measures of unionism \u2013 union recognition for collective bargaining purposes and union coverage \u2013 and plant closings. This association survives the incorporation of very detailed industry controls but is driven by plants that are parts of multi-establishment enterprises. There appears to be little or no statistically significant association for single plant enterprises. In explaining our findings, we address their consistency with the widely perceived reduction in the \"disadvantages of [British] unionism\" in recent years."

      "Games like EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot occasionally produce natural experiments in social science: situations that, through no intent of the designer, offer controlled variations on a phenomenon of theoretical interest. This paper examines two examples, both of which involve the theory of coordination games: 1) the location of markets inside EverQuest, and 2) the selection of battlefields inside Dark Age of Camelot. Coordination game theory is quite important to a number of literatures in political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology, but has had very few direct empirical tests because that would require experimental participation by large numbers of people. The paper argues that games, unlike any other social science research technology, provide for both sufficient participation numbers and careful control of experimental conditions. Games are so well-suited to the latter that, in the two cases we examine, the natural experiments that happened were, in fact, perfectly controlled on every relevant factor, without any intention of the designer. This suggests that large games should be thought of as, in effect, social science research tools on the scale of the supercolliders used by physicists: expensive, but extremely fruitful."

In this paper I first briefly review the microeconomic theory literature on durable-goods markets, focusing mostly on the last ten years. I then discuss a number of my own recent analyses concerning optimal antitrust policy in durable-goods markets that mostly build on ideas in the larger literature. Specific topics covered include: (i) optimal antitrust policy for durable-goods mergers; (ii) practices that eliminate secondhand markets; (iii) tying in markets characterized by upgrades and switching costs; and (iv) antitrust policy for aftermarket monopolization in durable-goods markets."

      "This paper analyses the link between sustainability-related innovation and sustainability performance and the role that family firms play in this. This theme is particular relevant from a European point of view given the large number of firms that are family-owned. Governments often support environmentally and socially beneficial innovation with various policy instruments with the intention is to increase international competitiveness and simultaneously support sustainable development. In parallel, firms use corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental management systems partly in the hope that this will foster such innovation in their organisation. Hence the main research question of this paper is about the association of CSR and environmental management with environmentally and socially beneficial innovation and its determinants. Based on panel data, the paper analyses the link of corporate sustainability performance with sustainability innovation and the effect of being a family firm using panel estimation techniques. The paper discusses the results of the analysis, which point to a moderating role of family firms on the link of sustainability innovation and performance and assesses the policy implications of this insight."

But JI as formally written down in legal texts is an imperfect predictor for de facto JI. This paper tries to identify the forces which determine de facto JI. A distinction between factors that can be influenced in the short run and those that are the result of historical development and that are exempt from short-term modification is made. Ascertaining the relative relevance of these two groups of variables promises to be policy-relevant. A rigorous empirical model reduction process is used in order to cope with the potential excess of explanatory variables. The explanatory variables for de facto JI that survive the reduction process are de jure JI, legal confidence of the public, extent of democratization, degree of press freedom, and the religious beliefs of the population."

      "Information costs and regulatory barriers are the main distinguishing features of international financial markets as compared to national financial markets. This paper presents a simple model of the impact of these factors on banks' cross-border activities and provides empirical evidence. Our dataset allows us to capture both the times-series and the cross-section dimension of information costs and changes in regulations, in particular, for intra-EU asset holdings. While EU membership per se seems to have had a negative impact on cross-border banking activities, the adoption of the Single Market clearly had a positive impact. While regulations and information costs are important for all reporting countries, their relative importance differs between countries."

      "This paper uses a combination of workplace and matched-employee workplace data from the British 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey to examine the impact of unions and firm-provided training (incidence, intensity/coverage, and duration) on establishment performance. The performance effects of training are indexed not just by individual and median establishment earnings but also by subjective measures of plant labor productivity and financial performance. Union effects on training are fairly subtle, and somewhat more positive when using individual rather than plant-wide training data. A positive impact of training on earnings is also detected in both individual and plant-based wage data, although consistent with much recent research the effects of union recognition are at best muted. There are also some signs of a positive interaction term for unionism and training in the earnings equations, but by the same token negative effects are encountered when training duration is expressed in categorical terms and interacted with union recognition. Instrumenting training yielded positive results for labor productivity and the firm?s bottom line. While some negative effects of multiple unionism at the workplace now emerge, they seemingly do not operate through the training route."

      "A widely spread belief among economists is that monetary policy has relatively short-lived effects on real variables such as unemployment. Previous studies indicate that monetary policy affects the output gap only at business cycle frequencies, but the effects on unemployment may well be more persistent in countries with highly regulated labor markets. We study the Swedish experience of unemployment and monetary policy. Using a structural VAR we find that around 30 percent of the fluctuations in unemployment are caused by shocks to monetary policy. The effects are also quite persistent. In the preferred model, almost 30 percent of the maximum effect of a shock still remains after ten years."

      "To identify the determinants of cross-country disparities in personal computer and Internet penetration, we examine a panel of 161 countries over the 1999-2001 period. Our candidate variables include economic variables (income per capita, years of schooling, illiteracy, trade openness), demographic variables (youth and aged dependency ratios, urbanization rate), infrastructure indicators (telephone density, electricity consumption), telecommunications pricing measures, and regulatory quality. With the exception of trade openness and the telecom pricing measures, these variables enter in as statistically significant in most specifications for computer use. A similar pattern holds true for Internet use, except that telephone density and aged dependency matter less. The global digital divide is mainly \u2013 but by no means entirely \u2013 accounted for by income differentials. For computers, telephone density and regulatory quality are of second and third importance, while for the Internet, this ordering is reversed. The region-specific explanations for large disparities in computer and Internet penetration are generally very similar. Our results suggest that public investment in human capital, telecommunications infrastructure, and the regulatory infrastructure can mitigate the gap in PC and Internet use."

      "The globalization of international financial markets has renewed interest in the measurement of capital mobility. Consumption-based tests such as the Euler equation test are commonly used. These tests, however, are derived under restrictive assumptions on consumer behavior. In this paper, we ask how the Euler equation test of capital mobility performs if these restrictive assumptions are relaxed. We simulate a dynamic general equilibrium two-country model under alternative assumptions regarding consumer preferences and use the simulated time series to test for the degree of capital mobility. We find that the Euler equation test discriminates fairly well between high and low capital mobility regimes even if the restrictive assumptions on consumer behavior used to derive the test are not satisfied."

      "The subject of the present paper is a simplified model for a symmetric bistable system with memory or delay, the reference model, which in the presence of noise exhibits a phenomenon similar to what is known as stochastic resonance. The reference model is given by a one dimensional parametrized stochastic differential equation with point delay, basic properties whereof we check. With a view to capturing the effective dynamics and, in particular, the resonance-like behaviour of the reference model we construct a simplified or reduced model, the two state model, first in discrete time, then in the limit of discrete time tending to continuous time. The main advantage of the reduced model is that it enables us to explicitly calculate the distribution of residence times which in turn can be used to characterize the phenomenon of noise-induced resonance. Drawing on what has been proposed in the physics literature, we outline a heuristic method for establishing the link between the two state model and the reference model. The resonance characteristics developed for the reduced model can thus be applied to the original model."

      "Guilds are social scientists? favoured historical example of institutions generating a 'social capital? of trust that benefited entire economies. This article considers this view in the light of empirical findings for early modern Europe. It draws the distinction between a ?particularized? trust in persons of known attributes and a ?generalized? trust that applies even to strangers. This is paralleled by the distinction between a ?differential? trust in institutions that enforce the rights of certain groups and a ?uniform? trust in impartial institutions that enforce the rights of all. Guilds had the potential to generate the particularized and differential trust to solve market failures relating to product quality, training, and innovation, although the empirical findings suggest that they often failed to fulfil this potential. Guilds also had the potential to abuse their trust, and the empirical findings show that they indeed manipulated their social capital of shared norms, common information, mutual sanctions, and collective political action to benefit their members at others? expense, blocking the spread of generalized and uniform trust. Counter to the assumptions of social capital theory, the example of preindustrial guilds suggests that the particularized and differential trust fostered by associative institutions do not favour but hinder the generalized and uniform trust fostered by impartial institutions."

      "Using a new data on 590 Turkish households in Berlin, we investigate the determinants and impact of integration on economic performance. We find that usual suspects such as time spent in Germany and education have positive impact, while networks have no impact on integration. There is strong evidence that political integration and the degree of full integration promote income. Using endogenous switching regression models, we show that local familial networks increase the income of unintegrated migrant groups only, while transnational networks decrease it. We also find that education is more welfare improving for integrated than non-integrated immigrants."

Dabei werden einige Aspekte der Einkommensverteilung aufgedeckt, die von der bislang allgemein unterstellten Stabilit\u00e4t abweichen. Einer dieser Aspekte ist der deutliche Anstieg der Ungleichheit unter den Arbeitseinkommen vollzeiterwerbst\u00e4tiger ausl\u00e4ndischer M\u00e4nner in Westdeutschland seit 1990. Als m\u00f6gliche Determinanten dieser Entwicklung werden sowohl die Merkmalsverteilung dieser Gruppe, als auch die ausl\u00e4nderspezifische Renditeentwicklung auf diese Merkmale untersucht. Die Merkmalsverteilung und die Renditen weisen Entwicklungen auf, die kausal hinter einer steigenden Einkommensungleichheit stehen k\u00f6nnen. Diese Trends sind als Anreize f\u00fcr Humankapitalinvestitionen von hoher Bedeutung und werden hier erstmals aufgezeigt."

Moreover, unawareness of general equilibrium effects may be an explanation of why regulations are introduced and why structural reforms are (not) undertaken."

      "We investigate public-private pay determination using French, British and Italian microdata. While traditional methods focus on parametric methods to estimate the public sector pay gap, in this paper, we use both non-parametric (kernel) and quantile regression methods to analyse the distribution of wages across sectors. We show that the public-private (hourly) wage differential is sensitive to the choice of quantile and that the pattern of premia varies with both gender and skill. In all countries the public sector is found to pay more low skilled workers with respect to the private sector, whilst the reverse is true for high skilled workers. The effects are more pronounced for females."

      "This paper investigates the effects of home-ownership on labour mobility and unemployment duration. We distinguish between finding employment locally or by being geographically mobile. We find that home ownership hampers the propensity to move for job reasons but improves the chances of finding local jobs, which is in accordance with the predictions from our theoretical model. The overall hazard rate into employment is higher for home owners, such that there is a negative correlation between home-ownership and unemployment duration. Our empirical findings thus lend some support for the main mechanism behind the so-called Oswald hypothesis, even if it does not find positive correlation between unemployment duration and home ownership at the individual level."

      "The paper explores the employment implications of allowing people the opportunity of using a portion of their incapacity benefits to provide employment vouchers for employers that hire them. The analysis indicates that introducing this policy could increase employment, raise the incomes of incapacity benefit recipients, and reduce employers? labor costs. The analysis explicitly derives the optimal voucher, i.e. the voucher that maximizes employment at no extra budgetary cost. This voucher is shown to depend on the size of incapacity benefits, the separation rate in the absence of the voucher, and the degree of displacement; but it does not depend on the hiring rate. Numerical calculations show the optimal voucher to be large by the standards of many existing employment subsidies."

      "This paper analyses the effects of activity choices on farm household income and consumption in a war-affected developing country. The study uses household survey data from Mozambique and controls for the endogeneity of activity choices with instrumental variables. War-time activity choices (such as subsistence farming) are shown to enhance welfare in the post-war period. Market and social exchange induce only limited welfare gains. Cotton adoption reduces household welfare, which contradicts previous studies not controlling for endogenous activity choices. The study thus demonstrates how standard predictions of economics may become invalid in post-war economies. Furthermore, the paper identifies pro-poor reconstruction policies."

      "We consider a model of a monopolistic network operator who sequentially offers two-parted access charges to symmetric downstream firms. We are particularly interested in analyzing an alternative to current regulatory practice of prescribing access. In particular, we look at the possibility of restraining the input monopolist's market power by endowing downstream firms with a regulatory option: In case they disagree with the contracts proposed to them, downstream firms can claim a regulated access price. It turns out that this form of regulation may prevent foreclosure even though allowing for price discrimination in the intermediary market. It proves itself more beneficial to welfare than the current practice of prescribing access prices above marginal cost. Interestingly, even though one expects discrimination against the first mover, non-discriminatory input prices below cost can occur when the monopolist faces the alternative of a rather strictly cost-oriented regulated access price. Non-discrimination rules will either not become effective or result in less optimal price levels."

      "I use a time-varying parameter model in order to study the predictability of monthly real stock returns in Germany over the period 1880?1913. I find that the extent to which returns were predictable underwent significant changes over time. Specifically, predictability of returns, as measured by their first-order autocorrelation coefficient, was positive most of the time. It tended to be significant during extended periods of stock market decline, but not during periods of stock market increase. I argue that this timepattern of predictability of returns is consistent with feedback effects of futures trading on the spot market."

This paper aims to re\u00adview the contribution of Keynesian and monetarist theories to this controversy and explores empirically their implications for the explanation of high un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in Germany using a structural vector regression approach. In addition, this paper discusses the so-called wage gap which plays an important role in the debate whether the German unemployment problem is a real wage problem. Even though this paper cannot hope to settle the unemployment controversy, it nevertheless shows why a consensus has remained elusive."

      "The EU Commission is advocating a common consolidated tax base for the corporate income tax, accompanied by a revenue sharing mechanism based on formula apportionment. We analyse tax competition in such a regime, focussing on the interaction between the definition of the tax base and the apportionment method. Tax competition leads to suboptimally low tax rates if and only if the investment elasticity of the tax base is lower than the investment elasticity of the apportionment factor. For any apportionment method a change in the definition of the tax base can turn a race-to-the-bottom in tax competition into a race-over-the-top."

      "We present a model where firms make competitive decisions about the optimal duration (or time to build) of their R&D projects. Choosing its project's duration, the firm can choose to become a leader or a follower, based on its R&D efficiency, the size of the R&D to be carried out and the degree of innovation, which this research will produce. It is shown that asymmetry in R&D efficiency between firms is an important factor determining feasibility of the preemption and attrition scenarios in competitive R&D with time to build. Scenarios of attrition and preemption games are most likely to occur when competitors have similar R&D efficiencies. In case of largely asymmetric firms the games of attrition and preemption are very unlikely, thus the R&D duration choices of firms are determined by the actual trade-off between the benefits of earlier innovation and the costs of faster R&D project completion."

      "Empirical evidence suggests that even those firms presumably most in need of monitoringintensive financing (young, small, and innovative firms) have a multitude of bank lenders, where one may be special in the sense of relationship lending. However, theory does not tell us a lot about the economic rationale for relationship lending in the context of multiple bank financing. To fill this gap, we analyze the optimal debt structure in a model that allows for multiple but asymmetric bank financing. The optimal debt structure balances the risk of lender coordination failure from multiple lending and the bargaining power of a pivotal relationship bank. We show that firms with low expected cash-flows or low interim liquidation values of assets prefer asymmetric financing, while firms with high expected cash-flow or high interim liquidation values of assets tend to finance without a relationship bank."

      "This paper analyzes the question whether money demand in the Euro area has undergone a structural change in recent time when M3 money growth has considerably overshot the reference value set by the European Central Bank (ECB). It is found that conventional specifications of money demand have in fact become unstable while specifications which are augmented with real stock prices and volatility remain stable. Using such an augmented specification, the claim that the excessive M3 growth rates are due to adverse stock market developments is examined. The results indicate that one cannot expect these growth rates to revert in the near future unless one is willing to assume a quick recovery of the European stock markets."

We give a necessary condition to have fully joint taxation in this framework and discuss some examples."

The main finding is that a Wald-test based on GMM estimation as derived by Kelejian and Prucha (2005a) performs surprisingly well. Our Monte Carlo study indicates that the GMM Wald-test is correctly sized even in small samples and exhibits the same power as their MLE-based counterparts. Since GMM estimates are much easier to calculate, the GMM Wald-test is recommended for applied researches."

      "This paper proposes a new method of calculating the proportion of permanently impoverished persons among persons in poverty as a whole. The paper shows that the widely used Shorrocks-Index for decomposing permanent and transitory inequality can also be acquired to describe poverty. This method overcomes certain difficulties involved in the methods of Rodgers & Rodgers (1993). The characteristics of the proposed Poverty-Stability-Index allow for an intuitive differentiation between the relative sizes of permanent and transitional poverty. Empirical results using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) will be presented for East- and West-Germany.",

Damit k\u00f6nnen Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten in der von Rodgers & Rodgers (1993) gew\u00e4hlten Berechnung behoben werden. Die Nutzung des hier vorgeschlagenen Armuts-Stabilit\u00e4ts-Koeffizienten erlaubt eine gut interpretierbare Unterscheidung der relativen Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von permanenter und transitorischer Armut.

Gegenw\u00e4rtig stellen die Art. 81 ff. des Vertrages \u00fcber die Gr\u00fcndung der Europ\u00e4ischen Union (EGV), die Kartellverordnung (KVO; erstmals 1962; Neufassung als VO 1/2003 seit 01.05.2004) sowie die Fusionskontrollverordnung (FKVO; erstmals 1989; Neufassung als VO 139/2004 seit 01.05.2004) die wesentlichen Institutionen dar. Zust\u00e4ndige Wettbewerbsbeh\u00f6rde ist die Europ\u00e4ische Kommission, Generaldirektion Wettbewerb als Ermittlungs- und Entscheidungsinstanz; die europ\u00e4ischen Gerichte (EuGI - Europ\u00e4isches Gericht erster Instanz; EuGH - Europ\u00e4ischer Gerichtshof) fungieren als Berufungs- und Revisionsinstanzen. Zus\u00e4tzlich verf\u00fcgen die Mitgliedstaaten \u00fcber eigene Wettbewerbsregeln und -beh\u00f6rden, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig ebenfalls das komplette Spektrum (Kartellpolitik, Fusionskontrolle, Missbrauchsverbot) abdecken, wenn sie sich auch bez\u00fcglich Tradition, Eigenst\u00e4ndigkeit und Bedeutung untereinander deutlich unterscheiden. Beispielsweise w\u00e4ren hier f\u00fcr Deutschland das Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen (GWB; erstmals 1958; aktuelle Fassung seit 01.09.2005) und das Bundeskartellamt zu nennen. Das Nebeneinander von nationalstaatlicher und europ\u00e4ischer Wettbewerbspolitik f\u00fchrt zu einem Zwei-Ebenen-System der Wettbewerbspolitiken in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, da die beiden Jurisdiktionsebenen nicht unverbunden sind. Mit anderen Worten, die wettbewerbspolitischen Kompetenzen sind vertikal (mitgliedstaatliche versus europ\u00e4ische Ebene) sowie horizontal (zwischen den Akteuren einer Ebene) voneinander abgegrenzt, wobei allerdings auch \u00dcberlappungen (konkurrierende Zust\u00e4ndigkeiten) auftreten. Die Art der Kompetenzverteilung und -abgrenzung ist dabei in der Kartellpolitik anders ausgestaltet als in der Fusionskontrolle. Dasselbe gilt f\u00fcr die Evolution der Kompetenzallokation, die im Mittelpunkt des vorliegenden Beitrages steht. Dabei wird untersucht, inwieweit sich wettbewerbspolitische Kompetenzen in der Kartellpolitik (Abschnitt 2) und in der Fusionskontrolle (Abschnitt 3) von der mitgliedstaatlichen Ebene weg auf die europ\u00e4ische Ebene verlagert haben, wobei die umfassende 2004er Reform der europ\u00e4ischen Wettbewerbspolitik, der so genannte Modernisierungsprozess, mit ihren jurisdiktionellen Implikationen im Vordergrund steht. Als Ergebnis dieser positiven Analyseebene kann formuliert werden: These I: Die allgemeine Tendenz besteht in einer zunehmenden Zentralisierung wettbewerbspolitischer Kompetenzen auf der EU-Ebene. Im Anschluss untersucht der vorliegende Beitrag, wie diese Entwicklung aus einer f\u00f6deralismus\u00f6konomischen Perspektive zu beurteilen ist (Abschnitt 4). Dabei steht die Frage im Zentrum der Betrachtung, ob eine Marginalisierung mitgliedstaatlicher Wettbewerbspolitik \u00f6konomisch zu rechtfertigen ist. Diese normative Analyseebene m\u00fcndet in: These II: Aus \u00f6konomischer Perspektive ist eine Verdr\u00e4ngung mitgliedstaatlicher Wettbewerbspolitiken nicht w\u00fcnschenswert."

      "This paper examines the impact of a change in the German child benefit system in 1996, which led to a large increase in lump sum transfers to families with children. We analyze the impact on the labor force participation of family members. Comparing behavioral changes of adults with children with behavioral changes of adults without children, we find that single mothers and mothers with a working partner considerably reduced the number of working hours (conditional on participation). Participation rates however did not decrease. For single fathers neither participation rates nor working hours display any significant changes."

      "Previous literature widely assumes that taxes are optimized in local public finance while expenditures adjust residually. This paper endogenizes the choice of the optimization variable. In particular, it analyzes how federal policy toward local governments influences the way local governments decide on public policy. Unlike the presumption, the paper shows that local governments may choose to optimize over expenditures. The result most notably prevails when federal policy subsidizes local fiscal effort. The results offer a new perspective of the efficiency implications of federal policy toward local governments and, thereby, enable a more precise characterization of local government behaviour in fiscal federalism."

      "Das vorliegende Papier beschreibt und analysiert die erfolgte Liberalisierung des Telekom-munikationssektors in Deutschland. Zu diesem Zweck werden die erfolgten Liberalisierungs-ma\u00dfnahmen beschrieben und ihre Auswirkungen auf die verschiedenen M\u00e4rkte analysiert. W\u00e4hrend der Wettbewerb in den M\u00e4rkten f\u00fcr Fern- und Auslandsgespr\u00e4che durchaus funktionsf\u00e4hig ist, ist dies im Ortsnetz und bei Vorleistungen noch nicht der Fall. Die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr den fehlenden Wettbewerb in diesen Bereichen sind unterschiedlich. W\u00e4hrend es sich bei Vorleistungen in vielen F\u00e4llen zumindest mittelfristig um resistente nat\u00fcrliche Monopole handelt, die die Eigenschaft wesentlicher Einrichtungen (?essential facilities?) haben, ist der fehlende Wettbewerb im Ortsnetz auch regulierungsbedingt. Vor allem die fehlende Orien-tierung der Endkundenpreise an geographisch unterschiedlichen Kosten tr\u00e4gt dazu bei, dass Markteintritt in vielen Regionen unattraktiv ist. Da die j\u00fcngsten Regulierungsma\u00dfnahmen wie das regulierte Resale und Call-by-Call im Ortsnetz zudem gerade die Erfolgsaussichten der bisherigen Investoren in alternative Infrastruktur schm\u00e4lern, ist f\u00fcr die Zukunft zwar mit einer scheinbaren Zunahme des Wettbewerbs im Ortsnetz zu rechnen. Zugleich werden jedoch die monopolistischen Strukturen im Infrastrukturbereich durch diese Form der Regulierung zementiert. Dies l\u00e4sst sich polit\u00f6konomisch leicht erkl\u00e4ren, kann jedoch langfristig zu Effizienzverlusten durch reduzierte Investitionsanreize f\u00fchren."

In this exploratory treatment, we report that the arrival rate of job offers declines precipitously with jobless duration and age; that reservation wages do decline with the jobless spell (and aggregate unemployment); that transitions out of unemployment exhibit strong negative duration dependence for reasons that have more to do with the arrival rate of job offers than with reservation wages; and that the decline in reemployment wages with joblessness closely shadows the corresponding fall in reservation wages."

      "Census data for 1990/91 indicate that Australian and Canadian female immigrants have higher levels of English fluency, education (relative to native-born women), and income (relative to native-born women) than do U.S. female immigrants. A prominent explanation for this skill deficit of U.S. immigrant women is that the United States receives a much larger share of immigrants from Latin America than do the other two countries. Similar to previous findings for male immigrants, the apparent skill disadvantage of foreign-born women in the United States (relative to foreign-born women in Australia and Canada) shrinks dramatically once we exclude immigrants originating in Latin America. In all three countries, men are much more likely than women to gain admission on the basis of immigration criteria related to labor market considerations rather than family relationships. For this reason, we might expect that the stronger emphasis on skill-based admissions in Australia and Canada compared to the United States would have a larger impact on cross-country differences in the skill content of male rather than female immigration flows. Therefore, our findings of similar patterns for men and women and of the key role played by national origin both suggest that factors other than immigration policy per se are important contributors to the observed skill differences between immigrants to these three destination countries."

      "Earnings less riskfree Interest Charge (ERIC) is a new residual income concept for Value Based Management (VBM), which takes the true risk and time preferences of shareholders into account. In this paper management based on ERIC is discussed from a theoretical and from a more practical point of view. Starting in a theoretical world it is shown that ERIC fulfills the specific basic theoretical requirements in all areas of VBM. In particular using ERIC in VBM ensures that planing, performance measurement, management incentives and decentralization are goal congruent with respect to market value. In a second step market imperfections and diverging preferences of managers, which lead to conflict of interest between individual shareholders and between management and shareholders, are considered. Accounting principles for determining residual income as ERIC are established. It is shown that regarding these accounting principles can substantially diminish conflict of interest and enhance shareholder value."

      "This paper provides evidence on the hypothesis that many behavioral finance patterns are so deeply rooted in human behavior that they are difficult to overcome by learning. We test this on a target group which has undoubtedly very strong incentives to learn efficient behavior, i.e. fund managers. We split this group into endorsers and non-endorsers of behavioral finance. Endorsers do, indeed, view markets differently as they regard stronger influences from behavioral biases. However, when it comes to the perception of one's own behavior the endorsement of behavioral finance becomes almost meaningless, even though endorsers otherwise do adapt behavior to their endorsement."

      "This paper takes a critical look at the trends in worldwide antidumping (AD) case filings during the last two decades. We examine the motives for AD filings by countries in an attempt to identify whether economic or strategic concerns are driving the recent upsurge in AD use. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the data on cases initiated in the 1980 to 1998 period. We then use non-parametric methods to identify national motivations for the use of antidumping. Results show considerable support for the importance of strategic concerns in driving AD case filings. This suggests that the rise in AD activity cannot be solely explained by an increase in unfair trading practices."

      "This paper models the short and medium-run impact of aid on migration, considering alternatively the effect of unconditional and conditional cash transfers to financially constrained households. Data from the evaluation of a Mexican development program, Progresa, are used to estimate the effect of the potential grant size on migration. The empirical analysis is consistent with model prediction. It shows that the program is associated with an increase in international migration, which is also a positive function of size of potential transfer. The grant may loosen financial constraints. At the same time, fine-tuned conditional grants targeting prospective migrants (in the form of secondary school subsidies) reduce the short-term migration probability. As regards medium-term migration, secondary school beneficiaries are not more likely to migrate than the control group after they complete the subsidised education cycle."

      "The labor market \"quality\" of immigrants is a subject of debate among immigration researchers, and a major public policy concern. However, traditional methods of measuring human capital are particularly difficult to apply to recently arrived immigrants. Many factors that have a negative effect on entry earnings also increase either the incentive or the opportunity for faster human capital investment and earning growth. In addition, many country-of-origin acquired skills that are not immediately valued in the U.S. labor market are useful to the acquisition of U.S. skills. Thus entry earnings are not a good measure of the stock of immigrant human capital. This article presents a model of immigrant human capital investment and, using 1970-1990 census data, presents strong evidence of a systematic and important inverse relationship between initial immigrant earnings and subsequent earnings growth. This result \u2013 which persists even after accounting for differences in the immigration flows from different countries, sampling error, and the effects of emigration \u2013 is fundamentally different from both earlier cross-sectional estimates and more recent pooled models that constrain cohort growth rates to be equal. Although our model provides theoretical support for an inverse relationship only when source country human capital is held constant, faster earnings growth for low-entry-earnings immigrants is found empirically even when age and education are not controlled for. The immigrant human capital investment model presented here explores general principles that may apply to other labor market transitions that involve skill transferability \u2013 including occupational change and labor market reentry."

Die damit angeregte Diskussion leidet aber unter einer gewissen Vermengung von Begriffen, die dieser Beitrag aufkl\u00e4ren soll.

      "Recently, the system of financing German sickness funds through payroll taxes has been criticized, and several experts have proposed a transition to uniform per-capita contributions as in the Swiss Social Health Insurance. However, the on-going debate on these questions suffers from a certain ambiguity of concepts, which this paper tries to clarify. It demonstrates that both in Switzerland and in the recent reform proposal contributions do depend on income, and it expresses the so-called ?uniform? premia in the usual form by calculating an implicit contribution rate and an income ceiling. The differences lie mainly in the inclusion of additional income sources and the application of the household principle in the system of levying contributions."

The results-based initially on national timeseries, and then on the relatively novel sub-national panel time-series T N data and analysis-show that the extreme inflation, combined with the incomplete indexation coverage seen at the time, had a regressive and significant impact on inequality. Thus, sound macroeconomic policies, which keep inflation low and stable in the long run, are to be a necessary first step of any policy package implemented to alleviate inequality in Brazil."

      "The economics literature clearly shows that the transmission of knowledge diminishes with physical distance, a factor contributing to industrial clustering. This paper investigates how those distances have stretched over time. We measure the physical distance between collaborating inventors, as well as distances between inventors and the technology cited in their patents. There is an obvious change over time while controlling for other factors, and we present interesting implications about the distance-dissolving effects of the communication revolution: firms and independent inventors benefit in distinctly different ways, while some states and technology classes are obvious winners over their peers."

      "This study tests the hypothesis that the ongoing restructuring process in the European electricity sector, as well as market participants? adaptation to the new legal framework, have caused electricity wholesale day-ahead prices to converge towards arbitrage freeness. Using hourly cross-border capacity auction results at the Dutch-German and at the Danish-German border for the years 2002 to 2004, and the respective spot prices, we estimate a time-varying coefficient model based on the law of one price (LOP). The results of these estimations are used to calculate the speed of convergence towards the LOP. While the German - Dutch prices and the German - West Danish prices are clearly developing towards arbitrage freeness, the German and East Danish prices do not exhibit significant convergence."

      "It is well established in the international literature that minimum wage increases compress the wages distribution. Firms respond to these higher labour costs by reducing employment, reducing profits, or raising prices. While there are hundreds of studies on the employment effect of the minimum wage, there is less than a handful studies on its profit effects, and only a couple of dozen studies on its price effects. Not only is the literature scanty on the minimum wage price effects, but also it lacks a survey on that. This survey represents an important contribution to the literature because it summarizes and critically compares over twenty price effect studies, providing a benchmark in the literature. This survey further contributes to the literature by offering an input to the recent debate over the direction of employment effects of the minimum wage. With employment and profits not significantly affected, higher prices is an obvious response to a minimum wage increase. Moreover, this survey also contributes to the literature by extending the current understanding on the minimum wage as a policy against inequality and poverty. If the minimum wage does not cause disemployment but causes inflation, it might hurt rather than aid the poor, who disproportionately suffer from inflation."

Regions which are situated in the periphery of the few growth poles often have to struggle hard for some economic dynamics. One such region is Northeastern Brandenburg. The paper evaluates its perspectives in the light of regional economic theory and discusses some options for regional specialization: First, forming an independent location of production in the tradition of the industrial districts; second, finding access to a division of labour with the Berlin region by exploiting lower production costs; and third, establishing production networks with the Polish border regions in which each side of the border specializes along its comparative advantages."

While the conventional within-country cross-section evidence remains controversial, recent contributions which control for potential resource endogeneity suggest that returns to resource usage in education are decreasing. Resources may render positive effects at very low endowment levels prevailing in many developing countries, but their effect is weak to non-existent in advanced countries. The missing resource-performance link in education also shows up in international cross-section evidence and in within-country time-series evidence."

      "The paper considers profit shifting behavior using data on German inbound and outbound FDI. It finds an empirical correlation between the home country tax rate of a parent and the net of tax profitability of its German affiliate that is consistent with profit shifting behavior. For profitable affiliates that are directly owned by a foreign investor the evidence suggests that a 10 percentage point increase in the parent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half a percentage point increase in the profitability of the German affiliate. On the outbound side of German FDI, the data provides some evidence that tax rate changes in the host country lead to a stronger change in after-tax profitability for affiliates that are wholly owned, which may reflect the larger flexibility of these firms in carrying out tax minimizing behavior without interference of minority owners."

      "A non-cooperative model of network formation is developed. Agents form links with others based on the cost of the link and its assessed benefit. Link formation is one-sided, i.e., agents can initiate links with other agents without their consent, provided the agent forming the link makes the appropriate investment. Information flow is two-way. The model builds on the work of Bala and Goyal, but allows for agent heterogeneity. Whereas they permit links to fail with a certain common probability, in our model the probability of failure can be different for different links. We investigate Nash networks that exhibit connectedness and super-connectedness. We provide an explicit characterization of certain star networks. Efficiency and Pareto-optimality issues are discussed through examples. We explore alternative model specifications to address potential shortcomings."

      "As opposed to many other school inputs, textbooks have frequently been demonstrated to significantly foster student achievement. Using the rich data set provided by the 'Program on the Analysis of Education Systems' (PASEC) for five francophone, sub-Saharan African countries, this paper goes beyond the estimation of direct effects of textbooks on students' learning and focuses on peer effects resulting from textbooks owned by students' classmates. Applying and extending nonparametric estimation methods from the treatment evaluation literature we separate the direct effect of textbooks from their peer effect. The latter clearly dominates but depends upon the initial level of textbook availability."

      "Against the background of an aging labor force in Germany and insufficient job chances of elders the paper rises the question, whether various age groups differ in their productivity levels. The analysis is carried out on the basis of a new linked employer-employee dataset for the years of 2000 and 2003. With respect to the manufacturing sector the cross section regressions provide unambiguous evidence for a higher productivity of mid-age-workers. In contrast the effects regarding the service sector turn out to be of less significance.",

      "This paper picks up the seminal model of Venables (1996) and provides a quantifying concept for the sectoral coherence in vertical-linkage models of the New Economic Geography. Based upon an alternative approach to solve the model and to determine critical trade cost values, this paper focuses on the interdependencies between agglomeration, specialization and the strength of vertical linkages. A central concern is the idea of an 'industrial base' which is attracting linked industries but is persistent to relocation. As a main finding, the intermediate cost share and substitution elasticity basically determine the strength of linkages. Thus, these parameters affect how strong the industrial base responds to changes in trade costs, relative wages and market size."

      "This paper examines how different unionisation structures affect firms' innovation incentives and industry employment. We distinguish three modes of unionisation with increasing degree of centralisation: (1) 'Decentralisation' where wages are determined independently at the firm-level, (2) 'coordination' where one industry union sets individual wages for all firms, and (3) 'centralisation' where an industry union sets a uniform wage rate for all firms. While firms' investment incentives are largest under 'centralisation', investment incentives are non-monotone in the degree of centralisation: 'Decentralisation' carries higher investment incentives than 'coordination'. Labour market policy can spur innovation by decentralising unionisation structures or through non-discrimination rules."

      "Die vorliegende Bev\u00f6lkerungsprojektion best\u00e4tigt weitgehend die bereits bekannten Tendenzen: Die Deutschen werden immer weniger und immer \u00e4lter. Die Projektion sch\u00e4tzt die Zahl der Deutschen getrennt nach Ost und West, sowie die Zahl der in Deutschland lebenden Ausl\u00e4nder mit einem Komponentenmodell Jahr f\u00fcr Jahr f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten 50 Jahre. Es wurden mehrere Varianten gerechnet, die insbesondere ein breites Spektrum an Annahmen zum Wanderungsgeschehen abdecken. Bei realistischen Zuwanderungsannahmen wird die Bev\u00f6lkerungszahl in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren geringf\u00fcgig, langfristig aber deutlich sinken. Vor allem jedoch wird die Bev\u00f6lkerung altern, denn beinahe unabh\u00e4ngig von der Zuwanderung wird die Zahl der J\u00fcngeren sinken und der Anteil der \u00c4lteren steigen. Nicht zuletzt deshalb ist die Bev\u00f6lkerung im erwerbsf\u00e4higen Alter, von 15 bis 64 Jahre (Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung), vom demografischen Wandel noch st\u00e4rker betroffen als die gesamte Bev\u00f6lkerung. Der Anteil der Erwerbsbev\u00f6lkerung an der gesamten Bev\u00f6lkerung geht zur\u00fcck. Langfristig wird damit die Basis des Arbeitskr\u00e4fteangebots deutlich schm\u00e4ler. Besonders stark sinkt die Zahl der Deutschen, wobei die neuen L\u00e4nder noch mehr als die alten L\u00e4nder vom R\u00fcckgang der (Erwerbs-)Bev\u00f6lkerung betroffen sind."

      "We exploit administrative data on young German workers and their employers to study the long-term effects of an early job loss. To account for non-random sorting of workers into firms with different turnover rates and for selective job mobility, we use changes over time in firm- and age-specific labor demand as an instrument for displacement. We find that wage losses of young job losers are initially 15% but fade to zero within five years. Only workers leaving very large establishments suffer persistent losses. A comparison of estimators implies that initial sorting, negative selection, and voluntary job mobility may have biased previous U.S. studies finding permanent effects of early displacements."

      "In this paper I present a methodology that uses matching comparisons to explain gender differences in wages. The approach emphasizes gender differences in the supports of the distributions of observable characteristics and provides useful insights about the distribution of the unexplained gender differences in pay. The proposed methodology, a non-parametric alternative to the Blinder-Oaxaca (BO) wage gap decomposition, does not require the estimation of earnings equations. It breaks down the gap into four additive elements, two of which are analogous to the elements of the BO decomposition (but computed only over the common support of the distributions of characteristics), while the other two account for differences in the supports. Using data for Peru in the period 1986-2000, I found that this problem of non-comparability accounts for 23% and 30% of the male and female working populations respectively. The matching methodology allows us to quantify the effect of explicitly recognizing these differences in the supports. In this way, the 45% gender wage gap in Peru is decomposed as: 11% explained by differences in the supports, 6% explained by differences in the distributions of individual characteristics and the remaining 28% cannot be explained by differences in observable individuals? characteristics. Approximately half of the latter is due to unexplained differences in the highest quintile of the wage distribution."

      "The most important responsibility of cooperative directors is to judiciously ask the right questions of management. It has been suggested that some directors do not know all of the correct questions to ask of management, or how. The purpose of this paper is fourfold: 1) To briefly describe how directors should pose questions to management, 2) To provide an extensive list of questions directors should know the answers to, 3) To outline a generic format for asking general questions and 4) To assist in identifying important board issues and how to handle them. Certainly this is not a complete list of questions or possible director concerns. However, we hope it covers most of the important issues directors will confront in carrying out their fiduciary responsibilities. We also suggest that these questions may be used by nominating committees and members to explore the cooperative business philosophy and knowledge of director candidates. In this paper, we have not provided answers to the questions. We assume directors that are elected to cooperative boards, in some cases multi-billion dollar companies, have sufficient business knowledge and experience to know the appropriate answers."

      "This paper investigates which policies CIS countries need to reform when they accede to GATT. The objectives to be pursued through trade policy (e.g. raising fiscal revenue, protecting industries, regional integration) must be defined clearly when tariff levels are bound. Some streamlining (e.g. tariffication of export quotas) is also required. The format of regional integration with Russia (free trade area vs. customs union with joint GATT membership) must not discriminate against GATT contracting parties, and will be influenced by whether Russia is willing to export energy at its low domestic price. Furthermore, systemic reforms need to be accelerated to dispel concerns about discrimination against imports, or hidden subsidies for exports."

However, principal-agent models question that NGOs decide autonomously on aid allocation. Indeed, we show empirically that NGO aid offers no panacea: The focus of NGOs on the neediest recipients turns out to be surprisingly weak. NGOs hardly make use of the perceived comparative advantage of working in difficult environments.\" Rather, they are strongly inclined to follow the herd of other NGOs and mimic the allocation behaviour of state agencies, especially if they depend on public co-financing."

From a theoretical point of view, the interaction between the different channels of integration can take different forms. The aim of this paper is to analyze the interaction between different channels of integration empirically. More specifically, we use state-level German data to answer the question whether and how migration and FDI decisions and thus integration of labor and capital markets are linked. Our findings suggest that FDI and migration have similar determinants. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that factors cluster."

      "I use the PSID to decompose the rise in wage inequality into a permanent and a transitory component. I consider separately job stayers and job changers. I find that earnings instability (the variance of the transitory component of earnings) increased much more among job changers than among job stayers. I interpret the evidence in a search and matching model with on-the-job search. The increasing variance of the transitory component of earnings is modeled as a mean-preserving spread of the distribution of productivity shocks. The meanpreserving spread induces on-the-job search on a wider range of productivity values. As a result of increased on-the-job search, the variance of the transitory part of earnings increases among job changers. The direction of the change in the transitory variance across job stayers is ambiguous and depends on their composition between non-seekers and on-the-job seekers who did not find a new job."

      "Under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, most U.S. taxpayers received a tax rebate between July and September, 2001. The week in which the rebate was mailed was based on the second-to-last digit of the taxpayer's Social Security number, a digit that is effectively randomly assigned. Using special questions about the rebates added to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we exploit this historically unique experiment to measure the change in consumption expenditures caused by receipt of the rebate and to test the Permanent Income Hypothesis and related models. We find that households spent about 20-40 percent of their rebates on non-durable goods during the three-month period in which their rebates were received, and roughly another third of their rebates during the subsequent three-month period. The implied effects on aggregate consumption demand are significant. The estimated responses are largest for households with relatively low liquid wealth and low income, consistent with liquidity constraints."

      "This paper examines the optimal design of pension plans when the health status during retirement is uncertain. Assuming that the health status affects both life expectancy and the marginal utility of consumption, choice between a lump-sum payment and an annuity can be welfare-enhancing if the health status is not observable by pension plans. This result holds if the marginal utility of consumption and life expectancy are negatively correlated. On equity grounds, a lump-sum option can be justified even if the marginal utility of consumption is independent of life expectancy."

      "The European Union's Council Regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development has introduced auctioning as a new instrument for granting agri-environmental payments and awarding conservation contracts for the recent multi-annual budgetary plan. This paper therefore deals with the conception and results of two case study auctions for conservation contracts. Results of two field experiments show much differentiated bid prices in the model-region and budgetary cost-effectiveness gains of up to 21% in the first auction and up to 36% in the repeated auction. Besides these promising results, some critical aspects as well as lessons to be learned will also be discussed in this paper to improve the design and performance of upcoming conservation auctions."

      "This paper makes three contributions to the literature on the effects of collective bargaining on the performance of German establishments. We include the analysis of firms' efficiency and we model productivity and efficiency simultaneously. Confronted with 25 % observations with missing values, we check the missing data mechanisms and find effects of firm size and collective bargaining on it, among others. After proper multiple imputation of the missing values - thus avoiding obvious nonresponse bias -, the results on the collective bargaining effects on productivity and efficiency change significantly. Finally, we suggest to multiply impute implausible zero values in the capital proxy as well."

      "In this paper we investigate when the male-female wage differential arises: Does it evolve over the early career or does it exist right from entry into first employment onwards? For the analysis we use new administrative longitudinal data and focus on the early careers of skilled workers in Germany. We adopt a simple human capital theory approach. Advantages of the data for this type of analysis are that we observe complete work and wage histories, and that we observe workers' skills. Regarding entry wages we find a gap of approximately 25 percent. For the early career, i.e. up to eight years of work experience, the differential stays almost constant at this high level. We find that differences in the apprenticeship training occupation explain the main part of this gap and seem to lead to a permanent wage disadvantage throughout the early career."

      "This paper offers a model to explain how computer technology has changed the labor market. It demonstrates that wage differentials between computer users and non-users are consistent with the fact that computers are first introduced in high-wage jobs because of cost efficiency. Furthermore, skill upgrading occurs because of a reemphasis on non-routine tasks after computer adoption. The model also reveals that neither differences in computer skills nor complementary skills are needed to explain wage differentials between computer users and non-users, skill upgrading, and the changing organization and intensity of work. Finally, the predicted effects on the wage structure following the diffusion of computers are consistent with the empirical evidence."

      "This paper studies Latin American exchange rate regimes since 1960. We model government exchange rate regime choice, constrained by politics. The model implies that the larger the tradable sectors exposed to international competition, the less likely is the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate regime. It also implies that the probability of the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate increases as an election approaches. We evaluate these implications with hazard models to analyze the duration dependence of Latin American exchange rate arrangements from 1960 to 1994. We find substantial empirical evidence to support the model. Results are robust to the inclusion of a variety of other economic and political variables, to different time and country samples, and to different definitions of regime arrangement. Controlling for economic factors, a one percentage point increase in the size of the manufacturing sector is associated with a reduction of six months in the longevity of a country?s currency peg. An impending election increases the conditional likelihood of staying on a peg by about 8 percent, while the aftershock of an election conversely increases the conditional probability of going off a peg by 4 percent."

      "A standard finding in the political economy of trade policy literature is that we should expect export-oriented industries to attract more assistance than import-competing industries. In reality, however, trade policy is heavily biased toward supporting import industries. This paper shows within a standard protection for sale framework, how the costliness of raising revenue via taxation may make export subsidies less desirable and import tariffs more desirable. The model is then estimated and its predictions are tested using U.S. tariff data. An empirical estimate of the costliness of revenue-raising is also obtained."

      "In this paper we study the structure of labor market flows in Spain and compare them with France and the US. We characterize a number of empirical regularities and stylized facts. One striking result is that the job finding rate is slightly higher than in France, while the job loss rate is much higher, putting Spain half-way between France and the US. This suggests that while Spain has borne the full cost of its labor market reforms in terms of job precarity, the benefits in terms of job creation have been quite modest. We hypothesize that this has been due to the reform's credibility being imperfect, which leads to expectation of reversal."

      "This paper investigates on the demographic, economic, political and cultural determinants of direct democracy in 87 countries using an index of direct democracy. The test is interesting since there are important variations across these countries in the referendum and initiative use. We apply a number of estimation techniques. We find that per capita income, education and a larger share of Catholic population are positive determinants, whereas ethnic fractionalization is depending on the estimation technique. Political rights and stability also work as prerequisites to direct democracy. Direct democracy seems independent from the institutional structure."

      "Collective wage agreements still play an important role in the German wage bargaining system. However, there is a critical debate in Germany whether collective agreements deliver the flexibility needed by firms to adjust to the needs of international competition and technological change. In recent years, the social partners in some industries have responded to this possible lack of flexibility by introducing so called opening clauses into their collective bargaining agreements. These allow firms to deviate from their collective agreement under certain conditions. The aim of this paper is to empirically analyze the prevalence of opening clauses in the German manufacturing sector and their impact on the wage structure. To provide a basis for the empirical analyses, a survey on the existence and intensity of opening clauses in central collective agreements has been conducted. Thereby, these sectoral data about opening clauses are exactly combined with those from the German Structure of Earnings Survey 1995 and 2001, a linked employer-employee dataset from German official statistics. The results show the number of collective bargaining agreements containing opening clauses increasing remarkably since 1991. Furthermore, the implementation of opening clauses into collective contracts creates significant effects on wages.",
      "Fl\u00e4chentarifvertr\u00e4ge spielen im deutschen System der gemischten Lohnbildung noch immer eine bedeutende Rolle. Ob die zentral verhandelten Vertr\u00e4ge den Betrieben ausreichende M\u00f6glichkeiten bieten, L\u00f6hne und Arbeitszeit an die betrieblichen Rahmenbedingungen anzupassen, ist jedoch seit geraumer Zeit Gegenstand einer zwischen Arbeitgebern und Gewerkschaften kontrovers gef\u00fchrten Debatte. Flexible Anpassungen an die betriebliche Ebene sind gerade vor dem Hintergrund des internationalen Wettbewerbs und technologischer Ver\u00e4nderungen erforderlich. Seit den 90er Jahren werden daher die kollektiven Tarifvertr\u00e4ge zunehmend dadurch flexibilisiert, dass \u00d6ffnungs- und H\u00e4rteklauseln vereinbart werden, die es den Betrieben erlauben, vom Tarifvertrag abweichende Regelungen zu treffen. Ziel dieser Studie ist es, das Vorhandensein von \u00d6ffnungsklauseln im Produzierenden Gewerbe zu erfassen und die Auswirkungen auf die Lohnstruktur zu untersuchen. Als Daten stehen Ergebnisse einer eigenen Erhebung zu Existenz und Grad der tarifvertraglichen \u00d6ffnung in verschiedenen Tarifbereichen zur Verf\u00fcgung. Diese werden der Gehalts- und Lohnstrukturerhebung 1995 und 2001 exakt zugespielt. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass die Zahl der Fl\u00e4chentarifvertr\u00e4ge, die \u00d6ffnungsklauseln vorsehen, seit 1991 stark angestiegen ist. Zudem lassen sich f\u00fcr die Einf\u00fchrung von \u00d6ffnungsklauseln zwischen 1995 und 2001 signifikante Lohneffekte beobachten."

Data from the German Socio-Economic Panel shows that the level of income also affects a person?s health and life expectancy. People?s self-assessment of their health and health-related quality of life follow a distribution pattern which can be described as gradient: the lower the income, the more frequent the impairments to subjective health. Life expectancy statistics also reflect income differences, primarily due to premature deaths among lower-income groups. Clues for explaining income-related differences in health and life expectancy can be found in the results on health-related behaviour and use of the medical system."

      "In this paper, the introduction of direct-democratic decision-making in all EU decisions is considered when it is feasible without prohibitively increasing decision-making costs. We start with the contractarian argument that each constitution is a contract joining the citizens of a state and requires as such the explicit agreement of (a majority of) citizens. Thus, the future European Constitution as well as future changes of it should be decided by the European citizens. After a discussion of the pros and cons of direct democracy, the ability of direct democracy to help creating a European demos is discussed. Consequently, we propose a mandatory (required and binding) referendum on total and partial revisions of the European Constitution. In addition, we propose a constitutional initiative, a statutory and a general initiative as well as a fiscal referendum for financially important projects."

      "Based on a panel data model this paper investigates whether the effects of fiscal policy on national saving in Europe have changed after the Maastricht Treaty came into force. Recently Giavazzi, Jappelli and Pagano (2000) found evidence that national saving responds nonlinearly to fiscal policy when a large and persistent consolidation is undertaken. I show that their finding is not robust, one reason being that the structural budget deficit is not a time-invariant criterion for identifying episodes of large and persistent fiscal impulses. This paper proposes and analyses an alternative definition of a fiscal consolidation episode: the post-Maastricht period."

      "While undernutrition among children is very pervasive both in Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia, child mortality is rather low in South Asia. In contrast to that Sub-Saharan African countries su er by far the worst from high rates of child mortality. This di erent pattern of child mortality and undernutrition in both regions is well known, but approaches using aggregated macro data have not been able to explain it appropriately. In this paper we analyze the determinants of child mortality as well as child undernutrition based on DHS data sets for a sample of ve developing countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. We investigate the e ects of individual, household and cluster socioeconomic characteristics using a multilevel model approach and examine their respective in uences on both phenomena. We nd that the determinants of child mortality and undernutrition di er signi cantly from each other. Access to health infrastructure is more important for child mortality, whereas the individual characteristics like wealth and educational and nutritional characteristics of mothers play a larger role for anthropometric shortfalls. Although very similar patterns in the determinants of each phenomenon are discernable between countries, there are large di erences in the magnitude of the coe cients. Besides regressions using a combined data set of all six countries show, that there are still signi cant di erences between the two regions although taking account of a large set of covariates."

We resort to within-state and across-state difference-indifference estimates to identify the reform effect on municipalities' business tax rates. Confirming the theoretical prediction, the reform had a significant impact on the municipalities' tax policy in the four years after the reform with a phasing out of the effect starting in the fourth to fifth year. The finding is robust to various alternative specifications."

      "We analyze wage differentials mobility between the formal and informal sector in urban Mexico, using panel data on five quarters drawn from Mexico?s Urban Employment Survey. We develop a dynamic random effects panel data model. It consists of two separate wage equations for the two sectors and a multinomial logit part explaining the labor market state, in which wages are included as explanatory variables. The model is estimated using simulated maximum likelihood. The estimates show that wage differentials increase with education level. The probability of formal sector employment strongly increases with the wage differential. Simulated transition probabilities show that for male workers, the choice between formal and informal sector is driven by wage differentials and unobserved heterogeneity, while true state dependence is much less important. For women, nonparticipation is the most common labour market state, and true state dependence plays a much larger role."

      "In this paper we test the hypothesis that intergovernmental grants allocated to co-partisans buy more political support than grants allocated to local governments controlled by opposition parties. We use a rich Spanish database containing information about the grants received by 617 municipalities during the period 1993-2003 from two different upper-tier governments (Regional and Upper-local), as well as data of municipal voting behaviour at three electoral contests held at the different layers of government during this period. Therefore, we are able to estimate two different vote equations, analysing the effects of grants given to aligned and unaligned municipalities on the vote share of the incumbent party/parties at the regional and local elections. We account for the endogeneity of grants by instrumenting them with the average amount of grants distributed by upper-layer governments. The results suggest that grants given to co-partisans buy some political support, but that grants given to opposition parties do not bring any votes, suggesting that the grantee reaps as much political credit from intergovernmental grants as the grantor."

      "Gegenstand dieses Artikels ist die Berechnung einer Translog-Produktionsfunktion f\u00fcr Gesamtdeutschland, die mit der endogenen Wachstumstheorie theoretisch fundiert wird. Die r\u00e4umlich-\u00f6konometrische Sch\u00e4tzung zeigt, dass die einbezogenen Produktionsfaktoren einen signifikanten positiven Effekt auf den Output aus\u00fcben. Die Wissensspillover sind relativ schwach ausgepr\u00e4gt. Insbesondere ostdeutsche Regionen weisen geringe \u00dcberschwappeffekte auf. Aufgrund einer fehlenden Internalisierung von Wissensspillovern lie\u00dfe sich ein staatliches Eingreifen begr\u00fcnden. Die Grenzproduktivit\u00e4ten von Arbeit und Humankapital streuen relativ stark, was eine weitere Flexibilisierung von Tarifvertr\u00e4gen nahelegt. Zudem scheint das Humankapital in einigen peripheren Regionen aufgrund des Zuzugs von Hochqualifizierten in Agglomerationsr\u00e4ume knapp geworden zu sein. Allensche Substitutionselastizit\u00e4ten belegen, dass indirekte Effekte einer Investitionsf\u00f6rderung auf die Besch\u00e4ftigung und von einigen Besch\u00e4ftigungsma\u00dfnahmen auf die Kapitalintensit\u00e4t bestehen.",
      "This paper examines a translog production function for Germany, which is based on endogenous growth theory. The spatial econometric estimation of this function shows that involved factors of production have a significant positive effect on the output. The knowledge spillovers are quite weak, especially in East German regions. Because individuals do not internalize spillovers, a governmental intervention could be founded. Marginal products of labor and human capital vary, so wage agreements should be more flexible. Some peripheral regions seem to be short of human capital because many high skilled workers move away from there. Allen's partial elasticities of substitution show indirect effects of investment promotion on employment and of some job creation programs on capital-labor ratio."

      "Why does individual performance pay seem to prevail in human capital intensive industries? We present a model that may explain this. In a repeated game model of relational contracting, we analyze the conditions for implementing peer dependent incentive regimes when agents possess indispensable human capital. We show that the larger the share of values that the agents can hold-up, the lower is the implementable degree of peer dependent incentives. In a setting with team effects - complementary tasks and peer pressure, respectively - we show that while team-based incentives are optimal if agents are dispensable, it may be costly, and in fact suboptimal, to provide team incentives once the agents become indispensable."

The empirical analysis relies on a system of demand equations that nests the translog, the generalised Leontief and the normalised quadratic specifications. Using panel data on 35 German industries, we find little evidence for a robust substitutability relationship between unskilled workers and OCM capital in manufacturing industries. In the non-manufacturing sector, however, we find some evidence for substitutability between OCM capital and unskilled workers."

      "This paper investigates short and long-run effects of trade liberalization on employment and wages. Employment and wage equations are estimated using data (1971?96) for importable and exportable sectors in Tunisia. Causality tests show that causality is unidirectional. Wages strongly causes employment but employment does not cause wages. There is significant difference in the direction of responses in the short and long run. Results from empirical testing using the models find only support for the short-run theoretical predictions for the exportable sector. Similar results obtained for the importable sectors. We find the differences in the short and long-run wage and employment responses to changes in export to be explained by learning by doing, organizational changes and improved factor utilization and labour productivity. A possible reason for the divergence of theory and practice is that the theoretical model is premised on the basis of a fixed supply of labour. Exportable employment could therefore only rise if importable employment fell. However, as we have seen, the supply of labour increased dramatically in Tunisia as women entered the labour market. This allowed importable employment to be maintained (even slightly increased) as the exportable sector expanded."

      "Vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen Debatte um das Thema \"mehr Besch\u00e4ftigung f\u00fcr wettbewerbsschw\u00e4chere Arbeitnehmer und Arbeitslose\" untersucht der Forschungsbericht die aktivierenden Wirkungen der ersten drei Stufen des Modellversuchs \"B\u00fcrgerarbeit\". Dieser Modellversuch wurde von der Regionaldirektion der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit (BA) Sachsen- Anhalt-Th\u00fcringen gemeinsam mit dem Land Sachsen-Anhalt entwickelt und zuerst in der Kurstadt Bad Schmiedeberg umgesetzt. Das Konzept der B\u00fcrgerarbeit hat sowohl Elemente von \"Workfare\" als auch eines \"Sozialen Arbeitsmarktes\" und sieht ein vierstufiges Vorgehen vor. Die ersten drei Stufen beinhalten ein umfassendes Profiling der Arbeitslosen, die Forcierung der Eigenbem\u00fchungen zur Stellensuche sowie ggf. den Einsatz des arbeitsmarktpolitischen Instrumentariums, um die Personen m\u00f6glichst rasch in den ersten Arbeitsmarkt zu integrieren. Erst wenn dies alles scheitert, soll die vierte Stufe - \u00f6ffentlich gef\u00f6rderte Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnisse - zum Einsatz kommen. Die Analysen zeigen, dass die Betreuung der Arbeitslosen in Bad Schmiedeberg w\u00e4hrend des Modellversuchs durchaus intensiviert worden ist. Dies schlug sich etwa auch - gemessen an der Anzahl der erstatteten Bewerbungs- und Reisekosten - in verst\u00e4rkten Eigenbem\u00fchungen der Arbeitslosen nieder. Dies f\u00fchrte aber nicht in gro\u00dfem Umfang zu z\u00e4hlbaren Arbeitsmarkterfolgen: Die Abg\u00e4nge aus Arbeitslosigkeit gingen weit \u00fcberwiegend in \u00f6ffentlich gef\u00f6rderte Besch\u00e4ftigung, w\u00e4hrend die Abgangsraten in Besch\u00e4ftigung auf dem ersten Arbeitsmarkt und in Nichterwerbst\u00e4tigkeit kaum positiv beeinflusst wurden. Eine m\u00f6gliche Erkl\u00e4rung hierf\u00fcr ist, dass die mangelnde Aktivierung der Arbeitslosen nicht der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr die lang andauernde Arbeitslosigkeit ist. M\u00f6glicherweise war der Zeitraum der intensiven Betreuung auch zu kurz, um schon deutlich messbare Erfolge zu erzielen. Durch die genauere Analyse und Dokumentation der Vermittlungshemmnisse der Arbeitslosen k\u00f6nnte aber eine Grundlage gelegt worden sein, bei Fortf\u00fchrung der Bem\u00fchungen zu besseren Vermittlungsergebnissen zu kommen."

      "I propose an econometric model that improves upon existing methods of estimating the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) by using information contained in the trend of productivity growth. My approach enhances the recently proposed model of Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997) in several respects. Statistically speaking, the method substantially shrinks the width of the 95% confidence interval, performs better in an out-of-sample inflation forecasting exercise, and is more robust to alternative statistical assumptions. In economic terms, the productivity-augmented model generates a more realistic time profile of the NAIRU, and implies estimates of the Phillips curve slope and the sacrifice ratio that are more in line with conventional wisdom. I also test whether the natural rate is correlated with the level or with the change of the productivity growth trend. I find support for the ?level? hypothesis in both the US and international data."

In this study the panel-p, the group-p, the panel-t, the group-t statistics of Pedroni (1999) and the standardized LR-bar statistic of Larsson er al. (2001) are considered. The simulation results indicate that the panel-t and standardized LR-bar statistic have the best size and power properties among the five panel cointegration test statistics evaluated. Finally, the Fisher Hypothesis is tested with two different data sets for OECD countries. The results point out the existence of the Fisher relation."

      "This paper examines the relationship between ?school quality? and earnings in the United Kingdom. The specific focus is on evaluating the effect that private schooling has on hourly wage rates. It is well known that private (i.e. fee-paying) schools compared to state schools score higher on most measures of school quality. Therefore by comparing individuals with private schooling to those with state schooling (and controlling for other variables) it is possible to indirectly evaluate the effect of school quality. Panel data from five waves of the British Household Panel Survey are used in the analysis."

      "We consider a case where some of the parents have higher ability to raise children than others. First-best policy gives both types of parents the same level of utility. If parental actions are not fully observable, however, the policy maker has to take into account the incentive-compatibility constraint that more able parents should not find it profitable to misrepresent their true ability by investing less in their children, and having a lower number of children. The second-best policy induces more able parents to have the first-best number of children, and to invest in each child at the first-best level. Less able parents are induced to have fewer children than in first best, and will underinvest in each child. Whether the government should subsidize more the more able parents, or the less able ones, depends on the properties of the cost function. In second best, however, less able parents will end up with lower utility than more able parents whatever the cost function."

      "This paper studies the relationship between fiscal decentralization and electoral accountability, by analyzing how decentralization impacts upon incentive and selection effects, and thus on voter welfare. The model abstracts from features such as public good spillovers or economies of scale, so that absent elections, voters are indifferent about the fiscal regime. The effect of fiscal centralization on voter welfare works through two channels: (i) via its effect on the probability of pooling by the bad incumbent; (ii) conditional on the probability of pooling, the extent to which, with centralization, the incumbent can divert rents in some regions without this being detected by voters in other regions (selective rent diversion). Both these effects depend on the information structure: whether voters only observe fiscal policy in their own region, in all regions, or an intermediate case with a uniform tax across all regions. More voter information does not necessarily raise voter welfare, and under some conditions, voters would choose uniform over differentiated taxes ex ante to constrain selective rent diversion."

      "At the beginning of the transition, the economic decline of agriculture partially relaxed the pressure on the wildlife. However, the policy continued to concentrate on regulating the intensity of production rather then creating incentives to produce environmental qualities. The structural adjustment process in agriculture caused the low return (poor) land to be released from production, especially, in protection zones with severe environmental restrictions. Land abandonment resulted in a rapid degradation of wildlife and landscape in places where these natural values were legally protected. The article examines the organisation of the provision of landscape and wildlife in the White Carpathians protected landscape area after 1997, when the new agricultural legislation and policy recognised compensations for restrictions and has gradually introduced incentives to cultivate potentially abandoned land. It was found that there was more than one governance structure, and that these were not necessary supporting each other. Our investigation concluded that solving the conservation problem is not separable from the rural development problem of the region, and therefore, that there is a need for participation of local community in terms of contributing producers but mainly consumers of high natural values."

      "This paper presents insights on U.S. business cycle volatility since 1867 de- rived from diffusion indices. We employ a Bayesian dynamic factor model to obtain aggregate and sectoral economic activity indices. We find a remarkable increase in volatility across World War I, which is reversed after World War II. While we can generate evidence of postwar moderation relative to pre-1914, this evidence is not robust to structural change, implemented by time-varying factor loadings. We do find evidence of moderation in the nominal series, however, and reproduce the standard result of moderation since the 1980s. Our estimates broadly confirm the NBER historical business cycle chronology as well the National Income and Product Accounts, except for World War II where they support alternative estimates of Kuznets (1952)."

      "We analyse contracts which pay out a guaranteed minimum rate of return and a fraction of a positive excess rate, which is specified on the basis of a benchmark portfolio. These contracts are closely related to unit--linked life--insurance/savings plan products and can be considered as alternatives to a direct investment in the underlying benchmark portfolio. The option embedded into the savings plan is in fact a power option, and thus the specification of the ``fair'' contract parameters is closely related to well known features of these financial derivatives. The key issue, both in order to rigorously justify valuation by arbitrage arguments and to prevent the guarantees from becoming uncontrollable liabilities to the issuer, is the risk management of the embedded options by a tractable and realistic hedging strategy. The long maturity of life--insurance products makes it necessary to lift the Black/Scholes assumptions and consider an uncertain volatility scenario, thus explicitly taking into account ``model risk''. In this context, we show how to determine the contract parameters conservatively and implement robust risk management strategies. This highlights the necessity of a careful choice of guarantees which are granted to the insurance customer and suggests a new role for a type of ``bonus account'' customary in many life--insurance contracts."

      "This study empirically investigates the transposition patterns of EU directives in all 15 member states and in six major sectors of the economy with a view on analysing the political-economic reasons behind sector and national differences in the legal transposition instruments used. In particular, we model the influence of both national sector importance and governmental constellations on the ratio of primary to totally transposed EU directives. We find that government strength and net EU receipts negatively affect the ratio of primary to total transpositions. Economic sector size plays a positive significant role for primary transposition ratios. However, the direction of the effect changes if we control for other sector characteristics, i.e. sector lobbying potential and technicality."

Results indicate that both countries became more unequal and less mobile labour markets, having departed from similar levels in mid-80s. The evidence does not support the idea that a more regulated institutional framework reduces individual mobility within the wage distribution."

      "This paper explores the issue of discrimination against Asian migrants in the Australian labour market using a unique panel data set, the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA). This paper estimates models of the probability of being unemployed for Asian and non-Asian migrants controlling for various characteristics including age, education, and English language ability. More importantly, we control for the visa status of the migrants. Our results suggest that there are significant ?unexplained differences? for males that may be ascribed to ?discrimination? against Asian migrants. However, the results for females are mixed: the evidence suggests that Asian females do worse than non-Asian females only in the first year after arrival."

      "In order to address the impact of regulation on ethical concerns of consumers, we study the effect of a minimum wage. In our experimental market, consumers have monopsony power, firms engage in Bertrand competition, and workers are passive recipients of a wage payment. Two treatments are employed, one with no minimum wage in the first part but with a minimum wage in the second part, and one treatment with a minimum wage at the outset that is abolished in the second part. In both treatments, wages decrease over time in the first part even though some consumers show an interest in fair wages. If a minimum wage is in place, wages decline even faster. Introducing a minimum wage in a mature market raises average wages, while abolishing it lowers them. We discuss the implications of our results, such as the crowding out of ethical behavior through legal regulation."

      "The Lerner paradox is the possibility that a tariff on an import good might worsen a country's terms of trade, and the Metzler paradox is the possibility that a tariff on an import good might reduce a country's import price. In a general equilibrium framework with multiple goods, this paper shows that the combination of the invertibility of the Slutsky matrix for the world economy and its similarity across countries will preclude both of the paradoxes, and that the combination of the gross-substitutes assumption for the world demand and the substitute assumption for the demand of an import country property of goods will preclude the Lerner paradox. A modified condition for the Slutsky matrix combined with the gross substitute for the world demand will do the same for the Metzler paradox. A concept of non-surpassed diagonal is used in deriving the result."

      "Since 1997, the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has met monthly to set the UK policy interest rate. We examine evidence of systematic patterns in exchange rate movements on MPC days over the first decade of operation of the MPC. Daily data reveal significant differences in volatility on the last of three meeting days when the interest rate announcement surprises the market. Intraday, five-minute return data are then used to provide a microscopic view. We use a Markov-switching framework that incorporates endogenous transition probabilities, which allows for an interesting alternative characterization of macroeconomic news effects on the foreign exchange market. We find evidence for non-linear regime switching between a high-volatility, informed-trading state and a low-volatility, liquidity-trading state. MPC surprise announcements are shown significantly to affect the probability that the market enters and remains within the informed trading regime, with some limited market positioning just prior to the announcement."

In our empirical application we demonstrate that moderately large birth cohorts seem to experience lower employment rates, but also that education investments might be able to mitigate these consequences, and that the relative economic success of large cohorts might even be disproportionately positive. Finally, in the concluding section we review possible policy options for coping with the consequences of population ageing."

      "Arguably, one of the most important developments in the field of applied economics during the last decades has been the emergence of systematic policy evaluation, with its distinct focus on the establishment of causality.By contrast to the natural sciences, the objects of our scientific interest typically exert some influence on their treatment status under the policy to be evaluated and on their economic outcomes. Thus, economic policy advice can only be successful, if it is based on an appropriate study design, experimental or observational. It will strive in societies that provide liberal access to data, accept the merits of randomized assignment and guard the independence of research institutions."

      "Germany's export market share increased since 2000, while most industrial countries experienced declines. This study explores four explanations and evaluates their empirical contributions: (i) improved cost competitiveness, (ii) ties to fast growing trading partners, (iii) increased demand for capital goods, and (iv) regionalized production of goods (e.g. off-shoring). An export model is estimated covering the period 1993 2005. The dominant factor explaining the increase in market share are trade relationships with fast growing countries. Regionalized production in the export sector also played a part. Improved cost competitiveness had a comparatively smaller impact. There is no conclusive evidence of increased demand for capital goods."

      "We consider a small open economy in which the level of public education funding is determined by popular vote. We show that growth can be enhanced by the introduction of pay-as-you-go pensions even if the growth rate of aggregate wages falls short of the interest rate. The reason is that the PAYG system allows future retirees to partially internalize positive externalities of public education due to the positive effect of higher future labor productivity on their pension benefits. The majority support for education funding will be especially strong when the PAYG benefit formula is flat, i.e. progressively redistributive. This means that if a flat benefit PAYG pension system is in place then the economy will achieve the highest growth rate relative to the alternative pension system designs. We argue furthermore that while such PAYG pension system may be opposed by the majority of working individuals due to inferior returns to their pension contributions relative to a funded scheme, it is likely to be politically sustained by the coalition of retirees and lower income workers."

      "I explore the implications of the lumpy labor adjustment as a propagation mechanism for aggregate dynamics. The model I use nests the basic RBC model with a staggered-job-turnover in the spirit of Taylor (1980) and Calvo (1983). It extends this approach by introducing a Weibull-distributed labor adjustment process to capture increasing hazard rates and heterogeneous labor rigidity in the economy corroborated by the micro data. My principal findings are: uncertainty in the labor adjustment process induces firms to make precautionary labor adjustment (the front-loading effect), amplifying the volatility of labor demand, and that the heterogeneity in labor rigidity leads to aggregate persistence in labor and output. The key message conveyed by this model is that heterogeneity in labor rigidity matters for the aggregate dynamics, and hence includes the information of the distribution of agents enriching the propagation mechanism of the RBC model."

      "This paper is concerned with the relationship among family members in the determinants of destination language proficiency among immigrants. A model of immigrant language proficiency is augmented to include dynamics among family members. It is tested using data on a sample of recent immigrants. Children are shown to have a negative effect on their mother?s language proficiency, but no effect on their father?s. There is a substantial positive correlation between the language skills of spouses. This is due to the correlation between spouses in both the measured determinants and the unmeasured determinants of destination language skills among spouses."

      "In federal systems, the powers and responsibilities must be divided up between central government and individual states in such a way as to enable the center effectively to carry out its duties for the nation as a whole, while allowing the lower levels of government to pursue their own regional goals at the same time. Thus, the main challenge is to find the best way to combine the advantages and disadvantages of centralization and decentralization respectively. In principle, there are two opposing normative models of organizing domestic fiscal relations. The first of these models is primarily inspired by distributive goals. Accordingly, revenue sharing is used as a tool to adjust \"unequal\" living conditions. This approach is exemplified by Germany, where the federal division of labor allows the lower levels of government very little discretion with regard to generating revenue. On the expenditure side, the system is characterized by an elaborate framework of domestic fiscal relations. Frequently, powers and responsibilities are shared by various levels of government, which regulary results in lengthy negotiations before the necessary broad-based consensus can be reached. There are many responsibilities that cannot be discharged independently. Equally, the extent of leveling is considerable."

      "The paper elaborates on the employment intensity of growth. Previous evidence regarding this question is surveyed. Empirical results concerning Europe and selected other industrial countries reveal that the cyclical link between unemployment and growth is still stable in the nineties. However, the relation strongly depends on the variable chosen to represent the labor market situation. Test on an asymmetric relation leads to ambitious results. Cross-country and panel evidence suggest that the employment intensity of growth is influenced by the country's wage setting process, the share of the service sector, and labor market flexibility. A clear-cut importance of exchange rate volatility cannot be found. Some conclusions with regard to economic policy are drawn."

      "The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of regulatory and environmental conditions on technical efficiency of European railways. Using a panel data set of 31 railway firms from 22 European countries from 1994 to 2005, a multioutput distance function model, including regulatory and environmental factors, is estimated using stochastic frontier analysis. The results obtained indicate positive and negative efficiency effects of different regulatory reforms. Furthermore, estimating models with and without regulatory and environmental factors clearly indicates that the omission of environmental factors, such as network density, substantially changes parameter estimates and, hence, leads to biased estimation results."

      "Zeitarbeit bietet Unternehmen ein zus\u00e4tzliches Instrument zur flexiblen Personalanpassung. Zudem er\u00f6ffnet sie Berufsanf\u00e4ngern und vormalig Besch\u00e4ftigten einen alternativen Weg in den Arbeitsmarkt. Der vorliegende Aufsatz analysiert die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung, die wechselnden gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und die \u00f6konomischen Entwicklung der Zeitarbeit am deutschen Arbeitsmarkt. Sinkende L\u00f6hne beisteigenden Besch\u00e4ftigungsanteilen deuten auf eine Ventilfunktion f\u00fcr den regul\u00e4ren Arbeitsmarkt hin, insbesondere f\u00fcr Arbeitskr\u00e4fte ohne Ausbildung. Hohe Aufschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr Zeitarbeitseins\u00e4tze trotz fallender relativer Entlohnung spiegeln zugleich einen erheblichen Schattenpreis f\u00fcr diese Arbeitsform wider. Zusammenh\u00e4nge zwischen Besch\u00e4ftigungsstand, Lohnniveau und -dynamik, Zugangsquote zum Sektor und Besch\u00e4ftigungsfluktuation deuten jedoch insgesamt eher auf Angebot- als Nachfragefaktoren hin als den relevanten Engpass f\u00fcr den bisherigen Ausbau der Zeitarbeitsbranche."

      "We develop a general equilibrium stochastic OLG model with heterogenous households. Households differ with respect to their productivity. Productivity depends stochastically on parents' unobservable investment in their child's human capital and an aggregate productivity shock. We introduce a PAYG social security system that conditions benefits on the aggregate wage sum and on the wage of one's child. We analyze the effects of such a social security system on the endogenous distribution of human capital and compare it to real world systems, which typically do not condition benefits on the wages of one's children. We decompose the effects of social security on the investment in human capital into an incentive effect, an insurance effect, a redistributive effect and a general equilibrium effect. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of social security on the long run distribution of human capital. Our approach suggests a novel role for a well-designed social security system: it can foster human capital accumulation and act as intragenerational insurance against human capital risk."

      "This paper uses micro data from the New Earnings Survey to document that cross-sectional wage inequality in the U.K., which rose sharply in the 1980s and continued to rise moderately through the mid-1990s, has remained essentially unchanged in the latter half of the 1990s. As in the U.S., changes in within-group inequality are shown to account for a substantial fraction of the rise in wage dispersion that has occurred over the last 25 years. However, shifts in the structure of employment \u2013 including changes in the occupational and industrial composition of aggregate employment \u2013 are also shown to have had important effects on the evolution of wage inequality. In addition, there has been a significant convergence of the wage distributions for men and women; this has had a stabilizing effect on the overall wage distribution."

Models of behaviour are therefore crucial for institutional analysis and design. In light of this, this paper draws lessons for institutional analysis and design resulting from the models of multi-attribute decision-making assembled in this special issue. That way, it contributes to assessing the external validity of these models with respect to one well-defined, and practically highly relevant, domain."

      "This paper develops a multi regional growth model of the second generation type with horizontal and vertical innovations. Technology goods are tradable between regions, creating a regional analogy of the weak scale effect introduced by Jones (2004). Per capita production in one region is a function of the weighted population sizes of trading partner regions. Thus the scale of partner regions diffuses between them. This result is empirically tested using data on the NUTS regions of the EU 15. A highly significant relationship is found between per capita GDP and an interregional scale variable, defined as a weighted sum of the populations of all EU 15 regions."

      "It is often argued that the tax on continued work should be removed by implementing actuarially fair schemes. However, these schemes cannot help fund the expected Social Security deficit. This paper proposes to give individuals only a fraction of the marginal actuarially fair incentives in case of postponed retirement. Social Security then faces a tradeoff between giving enough incentives to make individuals actually delay retirement and giving little increase in pensions in order to help finance its expected deficit. This trade-off is captured by a Laffer curve that we quantify on French data. Furthermore, we analyze the interactions between wealth and retirement behavior."

      "Germany is the laggard of Europe, yet the country is world champion in merchandise exports. The paper tries to solve this theoretical and empirical puzzle by diagnosing a \"pathological export boom\" and a \"bazaar effect\". Excessively high wages defended by unions and the welfare state against the forces of international low-wage competition destroy too big a fraction of the labour intensive sectors and drive too much capital and labour into the capital intensive export sectors, causing both unemployment and excessive value added in exports. Moreover, excessive wages induce too much outsourcing of upstream production activities which implies that export quantities grow too much in relation to value added contained in exports. Finally, excessive wages cause capital flight resulting in a too large current account surplus."

      "We report on several experiments on the optimal allocation of ownership rights. The experiments confirm the property rights approach by showing that the ownership structure affects relationship-specific investments and that subjects attain the most efficient ownership allocation despite starting from different initial conditions. However, in contrast to the property rights approach, the most efficient ownership structure is joint ownership. These results are neither consistent with the self-interest model nor with models that assume that all people behave fairly, but they can be explained by the theory of inequity aversion that focuses on the interaction between selfish and fair players."

      "Many European labor markets are characterized by heavy employment protection taxes and the widespread use of fixed-duration contracts. The simultaneous use of these two policy instruments seems somewhat contradictory since the former primarily aims at limiting job destruction whereas the latter clearly intensifies it. In this paper, we use a simple matching model with endogenous job destructions to analyze the impact of a combination of the two policies. We find that the political support of insiders to firing restrictions does not necessarily worsen unemployment. In fact, it may be the willingness of a majority of workers to support the combination of two instruments with opposite effects on job destruction and job creation that increase unemployment and deteriorates efficiency. Moreover, we argue, that the concentration of firm ownership is likely to influence labor market regulations. We show that the preferred point of a majority of workers is a very flexible labor market, without any firing cost when profits are evenly distributed across the labor force (which portrays a situation where firm ownership is extremely dispersed), whereas a combination of job protection and temporary jobs is preferred by workers when the share of profits that they earn is zero (which corresponds to a situation where firm ownership is concentrated among a few shareholders not participating in the labor market)."

      "In this paper we test for risk compensation in wages using Danish panel data. With the conviction that the type of education is as important as the education length, we use a very detailed description of the type of education reached by the Danish population to calculate different measures of earnings risk by education. Our long panel data set also allows us to decompose shocks in earnings in a permanent and a transitory component. We test the role of the risks associated to both components in wage compensation. We also experiment with new measures of earnings risk based on transitory intertemporal fluctuations in earnings. Thus, we get closer to risk measures catching the intrinsic long-run feature of schooling-risks and the required compensation. In concordance to what theory predicts, we find that the labor market compensates for such foreseeable risks. Hence, we state a return-risk trade-off for the human capital investments in Denmark."

      "A firm actively manages its rival's beliefs by disclosing and concealing information on the size of its process innovation. The firm's disclosure strategy results from the trade-off between two effects on product market incentives. First, the firm's competitor learns that the firm is efficient, which discourages the competitor. Second, the competitor becomes more efficient himself, since he can expropriate part of the disclosed knowledge, which encourages him. I characterize the equilibrium disclosure strategies for any knowledge spillover in a simple Cournot duopoly model, and illustrate the results graphically. Moreover, I compare the strategic disclosure equilibria with equilibria under non-strategic disclosure."

      "In Great Britain several policy measures have been implemented in order to increase energy efficiency and to reduce carbon emissions. In the domestic sector, these targets can be achieved by improving space heating efficiency and, hence, decrease heating expenditures. However, before implementing policy measures it is necessary to better understand determinants of heating expenditures. In this paper, we examine determinants of heating expenditures which include socio-economic and building characteristics as well as heating technologies and meteorological observations. In contrast to most other studies, we use Panel data for investigating household's demand for heating in Great Britain. Our analysis covers 15 years, starting in 1991, and more than 5,000 households that have been re-interviewed annually; altogether our sample covers more than 64,000 households. Our empirical findings suggest that in Great Britain owners generally have higher heating expenditures than renters. These differences in expenditures can be explained by building characteristics. Renters mainly live in flats and most of the owners live in detached/semi-detached houses. Generally, flats are more energy efficient than houses. Our results also imply that a number of socio-economic criteria have a significant influence on heating expenditures, independent from the central heating fuel type. Policy measures should not only focus on insulation standards but also on different household types. Especially elderly people and households with children should be target groups."

      "The theory of incomplete contracting is rival to that of complete contracting as a frame of reference to understand contractual relationships. Both approaches rest upon diametrically opposed postulates and lead to very different policy conclusions. From a theoretical viewpoint, scrutiny of the postulates has revealed that both frameworks are reasonable. This paper designs and implements an empirical test to discern whether contracts are complete or incomplete. We analyze a problem where the parties? inability to commit not to renegotiate inefficiencies is sufficient for contractual incompleteness. We study optimal contracts with and without commitment and derive an exclusion restriction that is useful to identify the relevant commitment scenario. The empirical analysis takes advantage of a data set from Spanish soccer player contracts. Our test rejects the commitment hypothesis, which entails the acceptance of the existence of contractual incompleteness in the data. We argue that our conclusions should hold a fortiori in many other economic environments."

      "We provide descriptive evidence from Miami-Dade County (MDC) in FL and from five representative areas in Massachusetts (MA) that government policies governing welfare reform, the child-care subsidy system, and minimum-standards regulations have had considerable influence on the availability, price, and quality of infant and toddler care as welfare reform progressed from 1996 to 2000. We suspect that the markedly different proportion of the population that is native born and differences in income and education in MDC and MA also have had an influence on the very different situations for infant and toddler care in MDC and MA. Our data suggest that minimum regulations for the care of infants and toddlers, market prices, and provider reimbursements in MDC are not in synchrony. For example, we estimate that, during the period of our study, a center-based provider would have to charge approximately $129 per week to cover the costs of providing full-time infant care that is in compliance with state-imposed minimum caregiver-to-child ratio requirements. We find that the vast majority of center providers in MDC charged less than $100 per week for infant care. In addition, the publicly set reimbursements paid to centers in MDC for providing full-time infant care never exceeded $95 per week during the period of the study. This suggests that, in order to be in compliance with the state-promulgated standards, infant care in MDC must be subsidized by sources other than the prices paid by parents or the State for the care of their infants. This is different from the situation we observe in Massachusetts, where prices, reimbursements, and regulations are more closely aligned. We find that prices of infant and toddler care in MDC are strikingly lower than in MA, even after adjusting for the higher cost of living and the more stringent regulatory environment in MA. We suspect, and provide some evidence, that this marked difference reflects, at least in part, lower average quality of infant and toddler care in MDC. We find that Florida?s welfare reform, with its requirement that cash assistance recipients be active when their youngest child is three-months-old and with stringent time limits for the receipt of cash assistance, is associated with a large increase in the number of infants and toddlers from low-income families in formal care. In contrast, Massachusetts? welfare reform, which imposes neither time limits nor activity requirements on cash assistance recipients with children under the age of two, is associated with only a moderate increase in the numbers of infants and toddlers from low-income families in care. For example, during our study period the number of infants in care increased by 150% in MDC and by only 10% in Massachusetts. During the period surrounding welfare reform, enrollments at facilities offering infant and toddler care in MDC increased if they accepted child-care subsidies and declined if they did not. Altogether, the growth in the full-time enrollment of infants and toddlers at subsidized facilities has been far less dramatic than the increase in the number of subsidies issued for infant and toddler care. This suggests that there may have been a displacement of private-pay infants and toddlers by those with child-care subsidies. During the period of our study, displacement by those with subsidies is more likely because payments to providers accepting vouchers exceeded the median prices charged by providers that did not participate in the child-care subsidy program. We find that the formal care of infants and toddlers in MDC, as compared to MA, is much more likely to take place at child care centers and much less likely to take place at family child care homes. We suspect that the more pronounced racial and ethnic diversity, higher poverty levels, and a much larger unlicensed, family child care underground economy in MDC have had considerable influence. We present evidence of some deterioration in the quality of infant and toddler care purchased with child-care subsidies in MDC during the course of welfare reform. Specifically, we observe an increase in the proportion of staff with less than a high school education at subsidized centers offering infant and toddler care. In addition, observational assessments of the quality of infant and toddler programs at subsidized centers in MDC indicate that the proportion of low-quality infant and toddler programs has approximately doubled (from 5% of programs in 1996 to 11% of programs in 1999) during the course of welfare reform. This is a worrisome development, given the large numbers of low-income infants and toddlers in formal child care in MDC. The level of accreditation of centers with infant and toddler programs in MDC (1 ? % of subsidized and 3% of unsubsidized facilities during the period of our study) is distressingly low. By way of contrast, over 30% of centers with infant and toddler programs that take vouchers in MA are accredited and between 20% and 25 % of those that do not take vouchers also are accredited. The low level of accreditation in MDC exists despite the fact that, under FL?s Gold Seal program, subsidized providers can receive up to a 20% increase in reimbursements if they become accredited."

      "The traditional economic approach to tax evasion does not appear to be particularly successful in explaining the extent of tax compliance. It is often argued that reciprocity norms which establish a fiscal exchange between the state and the citizens shape tax morale to a large extent. In that respect, a case study of Switzerland may be useful because the small size of the cantons and their direct democratic political systems procedurally establish a close exchange relationship between taxpayers and tax authorities. In this paper, evidence is discussed on how tax morale in Switzerland evolved over time. In addition, the impact of economic, legal, socio- demographic, psychological and institutional factors on Swiss tax evasion is analyzed. It can be concluded that Switzerland's system of responsive regulation increases tax morale."

      "Using data for German and Swedish multinational enterprises (MNEs), this paper assesses international employment patterns. It analyzes determinants of location choice and the degree of substitutability of labor across locations. Countries with highly skilled labor forces attract German MNEs, but we find no such evidence for Swedish MNEs. This is consistent with the hypothesis that German MNEs locate production stages intensive in high-skilled labor abroad. In MNEs from either country, affiliate employment tends to substitute for employment at the parent firm. At the margin, substitutability is the strongest with respect to affiliate employment in Western Europe. A one percent larger wage gap between Germany and locations in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is estimated to be associated with 900 fewer jobs in German parents and 5,000 more jobs in affiliates located in CEE. A one percent larger wage gap between Sweden and CEE is estimated to be associated with 140 fewer jobs in Swedish parents and 260 more jobs in affiliates located in CEE."

      "This paper proposes a method to decompose earnings inequality into a component due to unequal opportunities and a residual term. Drawing on the distinction between 'circumstance' and 'effort' variables in John Roemer's work on equality of opportunity, we associate inequality of opportunities with the inequality attributable to circumstances which lie beyond the control of the individual such as her family background, her race and the region where she was born. We interpret the decomposition as establishing a lower bound on the contribution of opportunities to earnings inequality. We further decompose the effect of opportunities into a direct effect on earnings and an indirect component which works through the 'effort' variables. The decomposition is applied to the distributions of male and female earnings in Brazil, in 1996. While the residual term is large, observed circumstances nevertheless account for around a quarter of the value of the Theil index. Parental education is by far the most important circumstance affecting earnings, dwarfing the effects of race and place of birth."

      "Economic theory suggests both positive and negative relationships between intra-firm wage inequality and productivity. This paper contributes to the growing empirical literature on this subject. We combine German employer-employee-data for the years 1995-2005 with inequality measures using the whole wage distribution of a firm and rely on dynamic panel-data estimators to control for unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneity problems and possible state dependence. Our results indicate a relative minor influence of intra-firm wage inequality on firm productivity. If anything, they provide some support for a view suggesting that some inequality may be beneficial, while too much leads to a detrimental effect on productivity."

      "A popular view of limited liability in financial contracting is that it is the result of societal preferences agnainst excessive penalties. the view of most financial economists is instead that limited liability emerged as an optimal institution when, in the absence of a clear limit on economic agents liability, the development of some economic activities might have been thwarted, Viewing the institution from the perspective of optimal legal system design allows us to better understand the current debate on it. We present a broad history of penalties in financial contracts to highlight the interactions between technology, legal environments, purpose of the financial relationship, and contractual provisions. We show that harsh monetary and non-pecuniary penalties are not mere relics from a bygone era and, at the same time, that limited liability is far from a recent institution. We then discuss trade-offs associated with legal mandates of either unlimited or limited liability, both for the contractin parties and for the rest of Society. We identify two broad patterns. First, the toughness of liability rules and bankruptcy laws decreases as exogenous sources of uncertainty become relatively more important, and increases with the opportunity for moral hazard (related to diligence, risk taking, or deception).Second, bankruptcy laws become more lenient as the scope for labor specialization and the returns to human capital or entrepreneuship increase."

      "This paper studies how different unionisation structures affect firm productivity, firm performance, and consumer welfare in a monopolistic competition model with heterogeneous firms and free entry. While centralised bargaining induces tougher selection among hetero- geneous producers and thus increases average productivity, firm-level bargaining allows less productive entrants to remain in the market. Centralised bargaining also results in higher average output and profit levels than either decentralised bargaining or a competitive labour market. From a welfare perspective, the choice between centralised and decentralised bar- gaining involves a potential trade-off between product variety and product prices. Extending the model to a two-country setup, I furthermore show that the positive effect of centralised bargaining on average productivity can be overturned when firms face international low-wage competition."

      "The paper compares the impact of corporate taxation and social insurance on foreign direct investment (FDI) and unemployment. Four main results are derived: (i) the optimal size of the welfare state depends on the degree of risk-aversion and the unemployment rate as a measure of labor income risk. The unemployment rate partly reflects the country's exposure to globalization; (ii) corporate taxation and social insurance have equivalent effects on unemployment and outbound FDI; (iii) while an increase in the corporate tax can raise corporate tax revenue, it is rather likely to worsen the government's total fiscal stance. A corporate tax cut can thus be self-financing due to fiscal increasing returns in the presence of a large public sector; (iv) a corporate tax should be used to contribute to welfare state financing only in exceptional cases when job creation is excessive and unemployment is inefficiently low. These conditions are probably unlikely to hold in Europe's generous welfare states with high structural unemployment rates."

      "In this article, a modelling framework for the information transmission between agents in an evolutionary game setting is proposed. Agents observe traits which reaect past and present behaviour and success of other agents. If agents imitate more successful agents based on these traits, the resulting dynamics are a multivariate stochastic process. An example for such a process is simulated. The results resemble the replicator dynamics to a remarkable degree. If traits moderately depend on the past, this accelerates convergence of the dynamics towards a stable state. If the dependence is strong, the stable state is not reached."

      "Democratic societies are challenged by various violent and organized groups, be they terrorists, gangs or organized hooligans. In exchange for offering an identity, leaders in such groups typically require members to be violent. We introduce a simple model to capture these stylized facts, and then study the effects of policing. We find that an increase in the marginal cost of violence always reduces violence, while increasing the indiscriminate fixed cost may backfire and result in smaller and more violent groups."

      "What role does labor play in firms? market value? We explore this question using a production-based asset pricing model with frictions in the adjustment of both capital and labor. We posit that hiring of labor is akin to investment in capital and that the two interact, with the interaction being a crucial determinant of market value behavior. We use aggregate U.S. corporate sector data to estimate firms? optimal hiring and investment decisions and the consequences for firms? value. We then decompose this value, thereby quantifying the link between firms? market value and gross hiring flows, employment, gross investment and physical capital. We find that a conventional specification \u2013 quadratic adjustment costs for capital and no hiring costs \u2013 performs poorly. Rather hiring and investment flows, unlike employment and capital stocks, are volatile and both are essential to account for market volatility. A key result is that firms? value embodies the value of hiring and investment over and above the capital stock."

      "The quality of public management is a recurrent concern in many countries. Calls to attract the economy's best and brightest managers to the public sector abound. This paper studies self-selection into managerial and non-managerial positions in the public and private sector, using a model of a perfectly competitive economy where people differ in managerial ability and in public service motivation. We find that, if demand for public sector output is not too high, the equilibrium return to managerial ability is always highest in the private sector. As a result, relatively many of the more able managers self-select into the private sector. Since this outcome is efficient, our analysis implies that attracting a more able managerial workforce to the public sector by increasing remuneration to private-sector levels is not cost-efficient."

      "This paper regards the incidence of in-work poverty and how it is reduced by the payment of social transfers in 20 European countries. It combines a micro- and a macro-level perspective in two-level models. The basis for the analysis is micro-data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) 2005 and macro-data from sources such as the OECD and Eurostat. The broad comparative perspective allows for a separation of different institutional influences, namely the influence of the degree of decommodification, defamilisation and bargaining centralisation. In contrast to previous studies on the working poor which have mainly described country differences in in-work poverty, this paper focuses on the question of how such differences can be ex-plained from a broader perspective of poverty research. In general, the results confirm the overall hypothesis that both welfare state measures and labour market institutions have an influence on in-work poverty. By analysing influences on pre-transfer poverty and poverty reduction separately, I show that such factors have varied effects on in-work poverty. While bargaining centralisation proves to be relevant for the distribution of pre-transfer incomes only, the set-up of the social security system in particular im-pacts the extent of poverty reduction."

      "This paper studies how national sentiment in the form of either a perception or a loyalty bias of bettors may affect pricing patterns on national wagering markets for international sport events. We show theoretically that both biases can be profitably exploited by bookmakers by way of price adjustment (odds shading). The former bias induces bookmakers to shade odds against the domestic team, the latter to adjust them in a way that depends on the demand elasticity of bettors for their national favorite. Analyzing empirically a unique data set of betting quotas from online bookmakers in twelve European countries for qualification games to the UEFA Euro 2008, we find evidence for systematic biases in the pricing of own national teams in the odds for win offered across countries. Variations in the sign and magnitude of these deviations can be explained by differences across countries in the respective strengths of the perception and loyalty biases among domestic bettors."

      "This paper seeks to disentangle the sources of correlations between high-, mid- and low-cap stock indexes from the German prime standard. In principle, such comovement can arise from direct spillover between the variables or due to common factors. By standard means, these different components are obviously not identifiable. As a solution, the underlying study proposes specifying ARCH-type models for both the idiosyncratic innovations and a common factor, so that the model structure can be identified through heteroscedasticity. The seemingly surprising result that smaller caps have higher influence than larger ones is explained by asymmetric information processing in financial markets. Broad macroeconomic information is shown to enter the common factor rather than the segment-specific shocks."

      "In this paper we explore the evidence that would establish that Dutch disease is at work in, or poses a threat to, the Kazakh economy. Assessing the mechanism by which fluctuations in the price of oil can damage non-oil manufacturing - and thus long-term growth prospects in an economy that relies heavily on oil production - we find that non-oil manufacturing has so far been spared the perverse effects of oil price increases from 1996 to 2005. The real exchange rate in the open sector has appreciated over the last couple of years, largely due to the appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. We analyze to what extent this appreciation is linked to movements in oil prices and oil revenues. Econometric evidence from the monetary model of the exchange rate and a variety of real exchange rate models show that the rise in the price of oil and in oil revenues might be linked to an appreciation of the U.S. dollar exchange rate of the oil and non-oil sectors. But appreciation is mainly limited to the real effective exchange rate for oil sector and is statistically insignificant for non-oil manufacturing."

      "We examine the impact of family income during childhood on the type of secondary school that German children attend, a good indicator of their lifetime socioeconomic attainment. By contrast with several US child outcome studies, we find that late-childhood income is a more important determinant of outcomes than early-childhood income, and income effects are not greater for poor households compared to rich households, other things equal. The income effects are small for native-born German children and non-existent for children from guestworker households. Income effects are also small relative to the impact of differences in parental educational qualifications or institutional factors related to the federal state of residence."

Their lending practice follows reasonable patterns as a standard set of variables, including indirect risk variables, explains much of the variance in interest rate spread. Reflecting institutional differences with mature markets, we find higher importance of relationship banking and risk control via credit availability. Information about later default reveals prudent relationship lending. However, banks could have made better use of available information about borrowers' riskiness. These findings do not support a general verdict of bad banking but indicate room to improve lending decisions."

      "Institutions - the structures of rules and norms governing economic transactions - are widely assigned a central role in economic development. Yet economic history is still dominated by the belief that institutions arise and survive because they are economically efficient. This paper shows that alternative explanations of institutions - particularly those incorporating distributional effects - are consistent with economic theory and supported by empirical findings. Distributional conflicts provide a better explanation than efficiency for the core economic institutions of pre-industrial Europe - serfdom, the community, the craft guild, and the merchant guild. The paper concludes by proposing four desiderata for any future economic theory of institutions."

      "The paper examines the relation between political participation and the size of regions taking German counties as observational units. The paper makes several contributions to the literature. To begin with, we measure political participation along two dimensions namely voter turnout, which is the most common variable used in empirical studies, and the number of candidates that run for a seat in county parliaments, a variable that has to the best of our knowledge never been examined at the local level. In addition, we fill a research gap because the issue of size and democracy has not been systematically investigated for Germany up to the present. It is shown, that the size of regions has a rather modest effect upon voter turnout and that active political participation is positively related - with however weak statistical significance - with the size of regions. In addition our results shed some further light on the importance of the educational attainment of the electorate on political participation. Our results indicate a strong positive impact of human capital on turnover. Based on the data presented and the results of our estimates we hypothesize that there is a hierarchy of elections on top of which are federal parliament elections whereas local and even state elections seem to be of much inferior interest to the electorate."

      "The Grand Transition (GT) view claims that economic development is causal to institutional development, and that many institutional changes can be understood as transitions occurring at roughly the same level (zones) of development. The Primacy of Institutions (PoI) view claims that economic development is a consequence of an exogenous selection of institutions. Our survey of the empirical evidence and our own estimates reveal that it is easy to find convincing evidence supporting either of the two views. Property rights do affect development as suggested by the PoI. However, democracy is mainly an effect of development as suggested by the GT. We conclude that the empirical results are far too mixed to allow for a robust assessment that one of the two views is true and the other false. This finding implies that focusing on institutional development is unlikely to be successful as the key strategy for the economic development of poor countries."

Quantile regression methods were considered in the context of the Brazilian manufacturing industry in 2005 and separate estimates were obtained for exogenous and endogenous sunk cost industries. The evidence favoured a convergence of the concentration lower bound towards zero in exogenous sunk costs industries in line with previous empirical evidence for developed countries. In ontrast, the magnitude was similar in the case of endogenous sunk cost industries what might reflect the low technological effort in that emerging economy."

      "Recent evaluations of active labor market policies are not very optimistic about their effectiveness to bring unemployed back to work. An important reason is that unemployed get locked-in, that is they reduce their effort to find a regular job. This paper uses an administrative dataset from the Slovak Republic on durations of individual unemployment spells. The focus of the analysis is temporary subsidized jobs. By exploiting the variation in the duration of these jobs it is possible to investigate whether or not the locking-in effect is important. It turns out that it is."

      "In the environmental economics literature the standard approach of modeling nonlinear production and abatement processes is to treat waste emissions \"simply as another factor of production\" (Cropper and Oates 1992). That approach doesn't map the materials flow involved completely and hides, moreover, the exact links between production, residuals generation and abatement. This paper shows that production functions with emissions treated as inputs can be reconstructed as a subsystem of a comprehensive production-cum-abatement technology that is in line with the materials-balance principle. In a simple economy with full regard of the materials flow it also explores the consequences for allocative efficiency and efficiency-restoring taxation of multiple and interdependent residuals generated in the transformation processes of production, abatement and consumption. Finally, the paper demonstrates that efficiency may require setting the emissions tax rate above or below conventionally defined marginal abatement cost if the residual subject to abatement is not the only residual causing pollution."

      "The financial integration in Europe concentrates on cross-border mergers rather than cross-border lending and emphasizes the need for harmonizing bank regulation and supervision. We study the impact of cross-border lending in a theoretical model where banks acquire either hard or soft information of borrowing firms. We test the model's predictions using the ifo business climate survey that reports the perceptions of German firms' credit availability between 2003 and 2006. Our results show that distance matters for cross-border lending, especially for the SMEs. In contrast to the policy of harmonization, differences in bank regulations may have speeded up the cross-border lending."

      "Biodiversity can sometimes only be preserved if natural habitats are excluded from human uses. Such protection measures generate positive externalities at the global scale. This holds especially for protection in developing countries that host great parts of global biodiversity. For internalization, financial resources are raised on a multilateral basis and transferred to the host countries. This paper reviews the rationale for protected areas and transfer payments and summarizes empirical data. The resources provided through multilateral mechanisms - even together with official bilateral aid and private spending - fall short of estimated needs for effective protected area systems in developing countries."

      "Transplants of donated stem cells save the lives of many patients with blood diseases. Donation is somewhat painful, but rarely has lasting adverse effects. Patients can accept transplants only from donors with compatible immune systems. Those lacking a sibling match must seek donations from the population at large. The probability that two persons of the same race are compatible is less than 1/10,000. Health authorities maintain a registry of several million genetically-tested potential donors who have agreed to donate if asked. We study the peculiar structure of voluntary public good provision represented by the registry, and compare the marginal benefits and marginal costs of expanding the registry."

      "Die Analyse der Arbeitsmarktdynamik ist von zentraler Bedeutung f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche und politikorientierte Arbeitsmarktforschung. Die Arbeitskr\u00e4ftegesamtrechnung (AGR) des IAB stellt die Best\u00e4nde und Bewegungen auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt in aggregierter Form dar und tr\u00e4gt auf diese Weise dazu bei, die komplexen Vorg\u00e4nge auf dem Arbeitsmarkt verst\u00e4ndlicher zu machen. Das Hauptziel der AGR ist es, die Dynamik des Arbeitsmarkts abzubilden, indem die Gesamtheit der \u00dcberg\u00e4nge zwischen definierten Konten innerhalb eines Kalenderjahres erfasst wird. Der Forschungsbericht stellt die konzeptionelle Vorgehensweise, die Datengrundlagen sowie ausgew\u00e4hlte Ergebnisse f\u00fcr das Jahr 2002 getrennt nach West- und Ostdeutschland vor. Den Ergebnissen liegen einige wesentliche Weiterentwicklungen der AGR zugrunde. Denn erstmals werden Individualdaten der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit (BA) systematisch genutzt, um die \u00dcberg\u00e4nge auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt mit einer AGR darzustellen. Methodisch besteht die wesentliche Herausforderung in der Verkn\u00fcpfung von Bestands- und Stromgr\u00f6\u00dfen aus unterschiedlichen Datenquellen und der Sch\u00e4tzung von \u00dcberg\u00e4ngen zwischen einzelnen Statusarten, die nicht mit Daten belegt werden k\u00f6nnen. Dazu wird das Sch\u00e4tzmodell ADETON verwendet, das auf der Entropieoptimierung basiert. Der Hauptvorteil dieses Vorgehens ist, dass Informationen aus unterschiedlichen Quellen in die Berechnungen einflie\u00dfen und die Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit der Daten mittels Restriktionen und Gewichtungsfaktoren ber\u00fccksichtigt werden kann."

      "A large fraction of the variation in wage levels and wage growth rates among individuals remains unexplained. Economists argue that ?unobserved? heterogeneity is among the more likely reasons for this unexplained variation in wages. The source of individual heterogeneity is typically attributed to data limitations and the unobservability of certain productivity related factors. In this paper we present a theory of career choice and derive a discriminating test between two inherently unobservable sources of heterogeneity \u2013 learning ability and workers? inter-temporal preferences (discounting) \u2013 both of which can clearly account for the variation in wage levels and wage growth rates. We apply this test to the large observed differences in wages and wage growth rates between smokers and non-smokers. The empirical evidence suggests that smoking is a proxy for individual discount rates."

      "This paper explores the short and long run effects of career interruptions on wages for young skilled workers in West Germany. The analysis distinguishes four types of career interruptions: unemployment, parental leave for female workers, national service for male workers and other non-work spells. We adopt the human capital model by Mincer and Polachek (1974) with homogenous human capital and test whether net depreciation is equal across types of employment interruptions, and equal in the short and in the long run. The main findings are that timing effects seem important and net depreciation differs across types of interruptions."

      "Numerous studies have tried to provide a better understanding of firm-level investment behaviour using econometric models. The model specification of more recent studies has been based on two main approaches. The first, the real options approach, focuses on irreversibility and uncertainty in perfect capital markets; of particular interest is the range of inaction caused by sunk costs. The second, the neo-institutional finance theory, emphasises capital market imperfections and firms' released liquidity constraints. Empirical applications of the latter theory often refer to linear econometric models to prove these imperfections and thus do not account for the range of inaction caused by irreversibility. In this study, a generalised Tobit model based on an augmented q model is developed with the intention of considering the coexistence of irreversibility and capital market imperfections. Simulation-based experiments allow investigating the properties of this model. It can be shown how disregarding irreversibility reduces effectiveness of simpler linear models."

      "Der europ\u00e4ische Rat von Lissabon hat ein klares strategisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Europ\u00e4ische Union gesetzt: \"Die Europ\u00e4ische Union soll zum wettbewerbsf\u00e4higsten und dynamischsten wissenbasierten Wirtschaftsraum der Welt gemacht werden - einem Wirtschaftsraum, der f\u00e4hig ist, ein nachhaltiges Wirtschaftswachstum mit mehr und besseren Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen und einem gr\u00f6\u00dferen sozialen Zusammenhalt zu erzielen\" (Romano Prodi, 12. November 2003). Mit dem Mandat von Lissabon hat die Europ\u00e4ische Union sich das Ziel gesetzt, Entrepreneurship als Hauptantrieb f\u00fcr Innovationen, Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit und Wachstum zu f\u00f6rdern. Die Proklamation alleine reicht f\u00fcr die Schaffung eines unternehmerischen Europas allerdings nicht aus. Wir haben uns die Frage gestellt, ob und inwiefern die neue \u00fcbergreifende Eu-Strategien zur F\u00f6rderung \u00f6konomischen Wachstums auf regionaler Ebene umgesetzt wird und exemplarisch das Enable-Programm in unserer Analyse aufgegriffen."

      "In this paper, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art in the econometric literature on the modeling of so-called financial point processes. The latter are associated with the random arrival of specific financial trading events, such as transactions, quote updates, limit orders or price changes observable based on financial high-frequency data. After discussing fundamental statistical concepts of point process theory, we review duration-based and intensity-based models of financial point processes. Whereas duration-based approaches are mostly preferable for univariate time series, intensity-based models provide powerful frameworks to model multivariate point processes in continuous time. We illustrate the most important properties of the individual models and discuss major empirical applications."

      "We study the implications of product and labor market imperfections for equilibrium unemployment under both exogenous and endogenous capital intensity. With endogenous capital intensity, stronger labor market imperfections always increase equilibrium unemployment. The relationship between the long-run unemployment and the intensity of product market competition is not necessarily monotonic, but there is an elasticity of substitution between capital and labor below one such that the long-run equilibrium unemployment is an increasing function of product market imperfections when the elasticity exceeds this threshold. Higher interest rates increase (decrease) the long-run equilibrium unemployment when the elasticity of substitution is below (above) one."

      "In this paper we study the decline in total fertility rates in the Czech Republic during the transition process. To identify transition-specific features of this decline we use a multiperiod model of birth process and apply it to the family and fertility survey of 1998. In a standard duration analysis setting the model allows for time-dependence of information sets, on which the decision about the next birth is made. It also enables to estimate probabilities of early exit from childbearing. In this work we find that the negative effect of transition on TFR is mostly translated through a sharply increased negative influence of higher education on fertility, and through the apparent lack of adequate childcare facilities."

      "For FDI to help achieve the international development goal of halving absolute poverty, two conditions have to be met. First, poor developing countries need to be attractive to foreign investors. Second, the host-country environment in which foreign investors operate must be conducive to favourable FDI effects with regard to overall investment, economic spillovers and income growth. This paper argues that it is much more difficult to benefit from FDI than to attract FDI. Weak markets and institutions typically prevailing in poor countries tend to seriously constrain the growth-enhancing and povertyalleviating effects of FDI. The crux is that creating an environment in which FDI may deliver social returns will take considerable time exactly where development needs are most pressing."

This paper analyzes the structural effects of investment subsidization as one of the core policy instruments by means of an error-correction model of factor demand and output. It intends to find out whether investment subsidization contributes to creating competitive economic structures, employment and growth or whether it just fosters an exaggerated capital intensity."

      "This paper investigates the capital market relations between Euroland and the USA from 1990 until 2006. Formally based on the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP), backward recursive estimations establish a long-run equilibrium between European and US government bond yields. Since the mid-1990s though, cointegration can only be achieved additionally considering the exchange rate. The reason proves a stochastic trend common to the European interest and the exchange rate, consistently explained by central bank reactions and unfinished learning processes on the role of the euro. Furthermore, the US capital market dominance is strongly reduced, leading to transatlantic interdependence at eye level."

      "This paper explores three aspects of strategic uncertainty: its relation to risk, predictability of behavior and subjective beliefs of players. In a laboratory experiment we measure subjects? certainty equivalents for three coordination games and one lottery. Behavior in coordination games is related to risk aversion, experience seeking, and age. From the distribution of certainty equivalents we estimate probabilities for successful coordination in a wide range of games. For many games, success of coordination is predictable with a reasonable error rate. The best response to observed behavior is close to the global-game solution. Comparing choices in coordination games with revealed risk aversion, we estimate subjective probabilities for successful coordination. In games with a low coordination requirement, most subjects underestimate the probability of success. In games with a high coordination requirement, most subjects overestimate this probability. Estimating probabilistic decision models, we show that the quality of predictions can be improved when individual characteristics are taken into account. Subjects? behavior is consistent with probabilistic beliefs about the aggregate outcome, but inconsistent with probabilistic beliefs about individual behavior."

      "During the last decades a consensus has emerged that it is impossible to disentangle liquidity shocks from solvency shocks. As a consequence the classical lender of last resort rules, as defined by Thornton and Bagehot, based on lending to solvent illiquid institutions appear ill-suited to this environment. We summarize here the main contributions that have developed considering this new paradigm and discuss how institutional features relating to bank closure policy influences lender of last resort and other safety net issues. We devote particular emphasis to the analysis of systemic risk and contagion in banking and the role of the lender of last resort to prevent it."

      "The determinants which are decisive for a successful accumulation of human capital and the transfer of these skills into the labor market are a contentious issue in the literature on the economics of education. Different studies on, for instance, the impact of school resources typically reach different conclusions even if they utilize the same dataset. The reason behind this is that each and every study decisively depends on a set of identification assumptions which are anything but innocuous for the results obtained.This paper aims at clarifying this point by embedding the discussion on the determinants of test success in international performance studies like PISA into a theoretical model of cognitive achievement and an empirical frame of reference."

      "The uniqueness of bounded local equilibria under interest rate rules is analyzed in a model with sticky information \u00e0 la Mankiw and Reis (2002). The main results are tighter bounds on monetary policy than in sticky-price models, irrelevance of the degree of output-gap targeting for determinacy, independence of determinacy regions from parameters outside the interest-rate rule, and equivalence between real determinacy in models satisfying the natural rate hypothesis and nominal determinacy in the associated full-information, flex-price equivalent. The analysis follows from boundedness considerations on the nonautonomous recursion that describe the MA(\u221e) representation of variables' reaction to endogenous fluctuations."

      "We examine how long-term life insurance contracts can be designed to incorporate uncertain future bequest needs. An individual who buys a life insurance contract early in life is often uncertain about the future financial needs of his or her family, in the event of an untimely death. Ideally, the individual would like to insure the risk of having high future bequest needs; but since bequest motives are typically unverifiable, a contract directly insuring these needs is not feasible. We derive two equivalent long-term life insurance contracts that are incentive compatible and achieve a higher welfare level than the na\u00efve strategy of delaying the purchase of insurance until after one's bequest needs are known. We also examine the welfare effects of such contracts and we show how third-party financial products, although beneficial to the individual in the short run, can be welfare decreasing over one's lifetime."

      "In this paper we demonstrate that there is evidence of an unstable and nonlinear relationship between fundamentals and exchange rates. Modeling this time-varying nature of the importance of fundamentals in a Markov switching framework substantially improves the fit of the real interest rate differential model and leads to parameter estimates, which in one regime are in line with theoretical expectations and allow us to draw reasonable conclusions on the influence of fundamentals on exchange rate dynamics. Factors which prove to be closely related to regime switches are short term interest rate, inflation differentials and differences in economic growth. Therefore fundamentals do not only matter for the exchange rate within each regime, but are also related to the switches between the regimes.",
      "In diesem Papier zeigen wir, dass f\u00fcr den Wechselkurs der Deutschen Mark bzw. des Euro gegen den US Dollar die Beziehung zwischen Fundamentaldaten und Wechselkursen instabil und nichtlinear ist. Durch eine Modellierung dieser zeitvariablen Einfl\u00fcsse der Fundamentals auf den Wechselkurs mit einem Markov Switching Modell lassen sich die Daten im Vergleich zu einem linearen Modell wesentlich besser durch ein Realzinsdifferenzmodell beschreiben, und es ergeben sich Parametersch\u00e4tzungen, die in einem Regime den theoretisch erwarteten Parameterwerten entsprechen. Somit lassen sich Wechselkurs\u00e4nderungen im Einklang mit Wechselkurstheorien besser erkl\u00e4ren. Determinanten der Regimewechsel sind insbesondere die Differenzen der kurzfristigen Zinsen, der Inflationsraten und der Wachstumsraten in den USA und Deutschland. Damit beeinflussen Fundamentaldaten nicht nur die Wechselkursdynamik innerhalb eines Regimes, sondern auch die \u00dcberg\u00e4nge zwischen den Regimes."

      "In this paper it is shown that allowing the deduction of work-related expenses has a strictly positive effect on tax efficiency only if two conditions hold jointly: (i) The expenses should be interpretable as real cost and (ii) the expenses should be required for increasing taxable income. Otherwise deductions are inefficient, neutral or ambiguous. Thus it is argued that the cost of commuting to work should not be deductible as commuting does not increase taxable income. The efficiency enhancing effect of deducting other expenses like educational ones or expenses for housework and child care is challenged on the grounds that these expenses are largely pecuniary costs."

      "Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), this paper analyzes the dynamics of equivalent income in Germany in the eighties and nineties. Special emphasis is given to the separation of permanent and transitory components, the persistence of transitory shocks and their implications for the persistence of poverty and income inequality. The results suggest that 52 to 69 percent of income inequality in West Germany were due to permanent differences between individuals and that poor individuals stayed in poverty for two years on average. In East Germany, the contribution of the permanent component to overall income inequality increased from 20 percent in 1990 to over 70 percent in 1998 and the persistence of poverty rose accordingly. The paper also looks at the special situation of population subgroups such as lone mothers, ?double income no kids? households, couples with children and pensioners."

      "The BioRegio contest and the BioProfile contest initiated by the German Federal Government have drawn much international attention as prototypes of a new kind of technology policy aiming at the exploitation of regional innovation and growth potential through clustering. There is, however, little systematic analysis of their actual impact on the development of commercial biotechnology in Germany. The current paper tries to fill this gap. We find that although these contests have catalyzed the emergence and early growth of German commercial biotech it takes more than isolated policy action by national governments to grow a self-sustainable biotech industry in Europe."

      "Instrumental Variables (IV) methods identify internally valid causal effects for individuals whose treatment status is manipulable by the instrument at hand. Inference for other populations requires homogeneity assumptions. This paper outlines a theoretical framework that nests causal homogeneity assumptions. These ideas are illustrated using sibling-sex composition to estimate the effect of child-bearing on economic and marital outcomes. The application is motivated by American welfare reform. The empirical results generally support the notion of reduced labor supply and increased poverty as a consequence of childbearing, but evidence on the impact of childbearing on marital stability and welfare use is more tenuous."

      "This paper assumes that individuals possess private information both about their abilities and about their valuation of a public good. Individuals can undertake collective actions on order to manipulate the tax system and the decision on public good provision. Consequently, an implementable scheme of taxation has to be collectively incentive compatible. If preferences are additively separable, then an implementable tax systems has the following properties: (i) tax payments do not depend on public goods preferences and (ii) there is no scope for a collective manipulation of public goods preferences. For a quasilinear economy, the optimal tax system is explicitly characterized."

      "The study evaluates different ESF-funded labour market programmes by comparing the labour market status at different points in time after the treatment. In order to solve the selection problem we employ a standard matching algorithm with a multi-dimensional distance measure. The effects of the analyzed programmes (wage subsidies, start-up subsidies and qualification measures for recipients of social welfare) are very heterogeneous. It can be observed that the direct integration into the regular labour market provides an advantage for the supported individuals. Its lasting effects, however, strongly depend on the group of persons being supported, the type of treatment and the employers\u2019 financial share.",

      "In this paper R2-type measures of the explanatory power of multivariate linear and categorical probit models proposed in the literature are reviewed and their deficiencies are discussed. It is argued that a measure of the explanatory power should take into account the components which are explicitely modeled when a regression model is estimated while it should be indifferent to components not explicitely modeled. Based on this view three different measures for multivariate probit models are proposed. Results of a simulation study are presented designed to compare two measures in various situations and evaluate the BCa bootstrap technique for testing the hypothesis that the corresponding measure is zero and to calculate approximate confidence intervals. The BCa bootstrap technique turned out to work quite well for a wide range of situations, but may lead to misleading results if the true values of the corresponding measure is close to zero.",

Ausgehend von der Bedingung, dass ein solches Ma\u00df modellierte Komponenten eines Regressionsmodells ber\u00fccksichtigen aber gleichzeitig indifferent gegen\u00fcber nicht modellierten Komponenten sein sollte, werden drei unterschiedliche Masse f\u00fcr multivariate Probitmodelle vorgeschlagen. Es werden Ergebnisse eines Simulationsexperimentes pr\u00e4sentiert, bei dem zwei der drei vorgeschlagenen Masse in verschiedenen Situationen verglichen werden und die BCa Bootstrap-Methode zur Testung der Hypothese, dass das entsprechende Ma\u00df gleich null ist und zur Berechnung approximativer Konfidenzintervalle evaluiert wird. Es zeigt sich, dass die BCa-Methode im Allgemeinen ordentliche Ergebnisse liefert, aber zu irref\u00fchrenden Ergebnissen f\u00fchren kann, wenn der \"wahre\" Wert des entsprechenden Ma\u00dfes nahe bei null liegt."

      "For a long time, migration has been subject to intensive economic research. Nevertheless, empirical evidence regarding the determinants of migration still appears to be incomplete. In this paper, we analyze the effects of socio-economic and institutional determinants, especially labor-market institutions, on migrants' choices. Based on a large data set constructed from micro-data for France, Germany, the UK and the US, we study their decisions to migrate to one of the four countries using a Multinomial Choice framework. Our estimates confirm a number of conventional results such as positive effects of wages and immigrant networks and negative effects of unemployment rates. In addition, we find that employment protection, union coverage and unemployment benefits have positive effects on migration. Also good education and health systems tend to attract migrants, while generous pension systems may deter them. Based on separate estimations for high- and low-skilled migrants, there is evidence that the effects of labor-market institutions differ across skill groups."

      "A history of the New Zealand immigration experience and policy is reviewed in this paper. Data from the 1981 and 1996 New Zealand Censuses are used to illustrate changes in the characteristics of immigrants, as well as labor outcomes. The decline in the income of recent immigrants over the period studied is found mainly to be due to changes in the region-oforigin composition. Immigrants are found to have lower income than natives upon arrival. However, income parity is reached after 20-30 years of residence. Immigrants with English speaking background do substantially better in the New Zealand labor market, relative to migrants with non-English speaking background."

      "We study the relationship between foreign exchange trading activity and volatility on the USD/EUR foreign exchange market on the basis of a unique data set around the events of 09/11/2001. We find that volatility and bid-ask spreads are by far larger at that time, but the shock is not persistent. The positive correlation between volume and volatility does not break up, but intensifies strongly indicating the arrival of new information and increased price risk. We conclude that the USD/EUR foreign exchange market maintains its liquid structure and its efficient processing of exogenous shocks."

      "This paper evaluates the evolution of European venture capital investments since 1990, using the distribution dynamics methodology. It tests and rejects the hypothesis that the international allocation of venture capital investments is driven by a pathdependent process of agglomeration, in which a country's initial advantage is transformed into a long-term lead. Instead, the evidence from a cross section of 13 European countries is more favourable for the alternative hypothesis, which explains international variations in venture capital investments as part of countries' different patterns of specialization. The robustness of these findings and implications for government policy are discussed."

      "Using the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data for the United Kingdom (UK), the paper specifies and estimates a \u2019complete\u2019 Hilden- brand Kneip (HK) model of consumption, extending earlier efforts that were \u2019partial\u2019 in nature. As the estimated parameters in the \u2019partial\u2019 HK model are time varying, the paper provides empirical evi- dence that their movements over time reflect a near unit root process. To estimate the \u2019complete\u2019 HK model, the paper specifies a simple OLS model of the \u2019remainder term\u2019 in the \u2019partial\u2019 HK model. The remainder term in the partial HK model, which as per theory should be influenced by unobservable variables like expectation formation of households, is found to be affected by housing prices. The complete model is found to explain movements in consumption better than the partial model. Results based on bootstrap suggest that given the sampling error in the FES data, the overall fit of the model should be considered as good."

      "In a recent paper Edward Lazear proposed the jack-of-all-trades view of entrepreneurship. Based on a coherent model of the choice between self-employment and paid employment he shows that having a background in a large number of different roles increases the probability of becoming an entrepreneur. The intuition behind this proposition is that entrepreneurs must have sufficient knowledge in a variety of areas to put together the many ingredients needed for survival and success in a business, while for paid employees it suffices and pays to be a specialist in the field demanded by the job taken. This paper contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by empirically testing Lazear's hypothesis using a large recent representative sample of the German population. The empirical estimation takes the rare events nature of becoming a nascent entrepreneur and the regional stratification of the sample into account. The results illustrate the statistical significance and economic importance of the jack-of-all-trades theory."

      "Since 1990 the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) uses a leading indicator in preparing short-term forecasts for the Dutch economy. This paper describes some recent methodological innovations as well as the current structure and empirical results of the revised CPB leading indicator. Special attention is paid to the role and significance of IFO data. The structure of the CPB leading indicator is tailored to its use as a supplement to model-based projections, and thus has a unique character in several respects. The system of the CPB leading indicator is composed of ten separate composite indicators, seven for expenditure categories (?demand?) and three for the main production sectors ('supply?). This system approach has important advantages over the usual structure, in which the basis series are directly linked to a single reference series. The revised system, which uses 25 different basic series, performs quite well in describing the economic cycle of GDP, in indicating the upturns and downturns, and in telling the story behind the business cycle."

      "In this paper I develop an intertemporal discrete choice model of labor supply. The framework incorporates the nonlinearities in the household budget set and accounts for state dependence in labor supply. Based on panel data for Germany (SOEP), I estimate this model using a dynamic conditional logit panel data model with random effects. The estimation results show that state dependence is significantly positive at the extensive margin, yet modest or non existing on the intensive margin. Using the Markov chain property, I derive short and long term labor supply elasticities on both the intensive and extensive margin. The labor supply elasticities di\u008eer significantly between the short and long run."

Persistent transfers through UI are present at both industry and firm levels, and an analysis using firm fixed effect indicates that an important fraction of variation in them can be attributed to firm effects. Calculations of overall efficiency loss are very sensitive to the degree to which firm level information is used. A full appreciation of how UI interacts with the labour market requires recognition of the characteristics and human resource practices of firms."

      "In a standard adverse selection world, asymmetric information about product quality leads to quality deterioration in the market. Suppose that a higher investment level makes the realization of high quality more likely. Then, if consumers observe the investment (but not the realization of product quality) before purchase, they can infer the probability distribution of high and low quality that may be put on the market. We uncover two effects that may lead the firm to overinvest in quality compared to a market with full information: first, an adverse selection effect according to which a sufficiently large investment can avoid adverse selection and, second, an efficiency effect according to which a larger investment reduces the probability of socially inefficient, low quality products in the market."

      "Many political issues like abortion, gay marriage or assisted suicide are strongly contested because individuals have preferences not only over their own choice but also about other individuals? actions. How should society decide these issues? This paper compares three regimes (centralization, decentralization and federalism) in an economy where individuals choose their residence and vote over a single-dimensional regulatory policy at the regional and national level. The main results are: (i) A move from decentralization to federalism, called moral federalism, is welfare improving behind the veil of ignorance if and only if centralization dominates decentralization, and (ii) for the group that favors a restrictive policy moral federalism is the more attractive the smaller its group size (subject to being the majority group), the larger the suffering from a given policy, and the smaller the regions? weight in determining the federal policy limit. The results are consistent with the Bush administration's attempt to restrict liberal policy choices at the state level after its narrow election victory in 2000."

For this purpose we apply indirect inference methods, that is we specify the parameters of the theoretical model such that simulated data mimics observed data as closely as possible. In addition to the identification of structural shocks, we uncover the unobservable output gap, which is a prominent indicator in business cycle analysis. Furthermore, we show to which extent each identified shock has contributed to the business cycle fluctuations. - Business cycle accounting ; dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models ; Germany ; indirect inference ; New Keynesian macroeconomics"

      "If migrants return to their origin countries, two questions arise which are of immediate economic interest for both immigration and emigration country: What determines their optimal migration duration, and what are the activities migrants choose after a return. Little research has been devoted to these two issues. This paper utilises a unique survey data set which records activities of returned migrants. We first illustrate the activities of immigrants after returning. We show that more than half of the returning migrants are economically active after return, and most of them engage in entrepreneurial activities. We then develop a model, where migrants decide simultaneously about the optimal migration duration, and their after-return activities. Guided by this model, we specify and estimate an empirical model, where the after-return activity, and the optimal migration duration are simultaneously chosen."

      "This paper uses a dynamic general equilibrium optimizing two-country model to analyze how the formation of exchange rate expectations shapes the effects of monetary policy shocks in open economies. The model implies that the short-run output effects of permanent monetary policy shocks diminish if 'noise traders' in the foreign exchange market form regressive exchange rate expectations. If the influence of these noise traders is strong enough, a permanent expansionary monetary policy shock can result in a temporary decline of the output in the country in which it takes place. The output effects of temporary monetary policy shocks are magnified when noise traders form regressive exchange rate expectations."

      "The introduction of the euro marks a milestone in the process of European financial market integration. This paper analyzes the implications of the euro for cross-border banking activities. A portfolio model is used which captures the role of banks as providers of informational and of risk-diversification services. By eliminating exchange rate risks, the euro enhances the incentives of banks to expand within Euroland. Yet, while the currency bias in bank portfolios will be eliminated, the home bias will remain. It is also argued that positive diversification effects may outweigh possible negative effects on the risk taking of banks."

      "Cross-country evidence on student achievement might be hampered by omitted country characteristics such as language or legal differences. This paper uses cross-state variation in Germany, whose sixteen states share the same language and legal system, but pursue different education policies. The same results found previously across countries hold within Germany: Higher mean student performance is associated with central exams, private school operation, and socio-economic background, but not with spending, while higher equality of opportunity is associated with reduced tracking. In a model that pools German states with OECD countries, these fundamental determinants do not differ significantly between the two samples."

      "Immigrants in Germany display a poor earnings performance relative to natives. Arguing that human capital endowments identify earnings potentials rather than actual earnings, this paper estimates a stochastic earnings frontier and searches for systematic differences between natives and migrants in terms of distance to the frontier. GSOEP-Data of the year 2000 is used for estimation. The empirical results clearly support the frontier assumption, but - surprisingly - find natives and immigrants at about the same distance to the frontier. Assuming a halfnormal distribution of the wage-inefficiency term, both groups transformed on average a modest 81% share of their potential income into market earnings. Due to the similar positions of natives and immigrants relative to the frontier, the wage discrimination hypothesis is rejected. Actually, human capital differentials are clearly the most important source for wage inequality. The earnings frontiers of immigrants from Eastern Europe as well as from Turkey are steeper than the respective frontier of natives, which supports the assimilation hypothesis. No assimilation is found for migrants from the European Union and from the former Yugoslavia."

      "The differential response of cash reserves of member banks and nonmember banks not subject to the 1936-37 increase in reserve requirements is estimated to determine whether the 1937-38 recession was caused by the increase in reserve requirements. We identify 17 states that maintained constant reserve requirements from June 1934 to June 1941. While member banks increased their cash reserve ratios relative to nonmember banks, the magnitude of the adjustment is too small to have contributed to the 1937-38 recession. Shock prices and public reaction to the increase in reserve requirements are consistent with the empirical results. While the Fed was responsible for the Great Contraction, the results are inconsistent with the view the Fed?s reserve requirement increase contributed significantly to the 1937-38 recession."

This paper broadens the discussion with a concept of incentive ethics. It analyzes how the dependency on benefits can be left out by allocating so-called moral goods to the long-term unemployed. Comparing the new concept with the last reform (\"Hartz IV\"), the shortcomings of this reform are revealed. Thus, the paper concludes with a new reform proposal."

This paper extends this to unfunded public pensions with the help of ?implicit tax? in pension contributions. The clearest advantages of the revision appear in situations where pension liabilities are shifted from the corporate sector to government, and where part of the public pension system is privatised. The proposed revision raises public debt and deficit to new orders of magnitude. The paper provides a framework for setting the debt and deficit targets under both current and proposed definitions."

      "During the last two decades economists have made much progress in understanding incentives, contracts and organisations. Yet, they constrained their attention to a very narrow and empirically questionable view of human motivation. The purpose of this paper is to show that this narrow view of human motivation may severely limit understanding the determinants and effects of incentives. Economists may fail to understand the levels and the changes in behaviour if they neglect motives like the desire to reciprocate or the desire to avoid social disapproval. We show that monetary incentives may backfire and reduce the performance of agents or their compliance with rules. In addition, these motives may generate very powerful incentives themselves."

      "Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird mit Hilfe der Szenario-Technik auf Basis eines Nutzen-Kosten-Modells untersucht, welche Anreize f\u00fcr inl\u00e4ndische Kraftfahrer bei gegebenen Kraftstoffpreisdifferenzen gegen\u00fcber dem Ausland bestehen, den ben\u00f6tigten Kraftstoff jenseits der Landesgrenze zu beziehen. Dabei werden die F\u00e4lle eingeschr\u00e4nkter und vollst\u00e4ndiger Rationalit\u00e4t unterschieden. Bei eingeschr\u00e4nkter Rationalit\u00e4t basiert die Entscheidung der Kraftfahrer lediglich auf den zus\u00e4tzlichen Kraftstoffkosten und der M\u00fchsal des zus\u00e4tzlich in Kauf genommenen Anfahrtsweges; bei vollst\u00e4ndiger Rationalit\u00e4t werden dagegen alle relevanten Kostenkomponenten beachtet. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass im Fall eingeschr\u00e4nkter Rationalit\u00e4t, der der allgemeinen Lebenserfahrung entspricht, bereits bei vergleichsweise geringen Preisdifferenzen ein erheblicher Anreiz zu Tanktourismus existiert. Der Schl\u00fcssel zu einer - zumindest partiellen - L\u00f6sung dieses Problems besteht darin, den Kraftfahrern jenseits aller Diskussionen \u00fcber externe Umweltkosten die vollen, tats\u00e4chlich heute bereits von ihnen selbst zu tragenden Kosten des Autofahrens st\u00e4rker als bisher in das Bewusstsein zu rufen.",
      "The present paper analyzes the incentives of domestic car drivers to get their fuel beyond the border line due to given price differences (?fuel tourism?). The paper distinguishes the cases of limited and complete rationality. Limited rationality means that the decision of car drivers is solely based on additional fuel costs and time effort; complete rationality, in contrast, means that all pri-vate costs are taken into account. The outcome shows that, regarding the case of limited rationality, even comparably small price differences induce a strong incentive for ?fuel tourism?. The key to a solution for this problem is to make car drivers more aware of the complete private costs of driving which they are already paying for today."

      "The labour market providing individual resources and economic well-being is an actual topic in the economic and social policy discussion. In the course of time the traditional full-time work is diminishing, new labour arrangements are discussed (keyword: flexible labour markets). This study will contribute to the discussion of working hour arrangements by quantifying patterns of explanation of ?who is working when within a workday?. In particular we want to disentangle certain working hour patterns and the final hours of work according to those different patterns allowing for market and non-market influences. The daily working hour patterns are analysed by two dimensions: the fragmentation of a working day (by the number of working episodes) and the timing of work time by location of those episodes within the day?s period. Based on an extended microeconomic labour supply/household production our microeconometric estimates use a multinomial logit (MNL) model to explain the working hour arrangement probability and a MNL selectivity bias corrected hours estimation for arrangement specific working hours with correct asymptotic covariances. Our study is the first German study of this kind which could analyse the actual available German Time Use Survey 1991/92 from the Federal Statistical Office with ca. 32.000 time diaries."

      "We extend the analysis of Christoffersen and Diebold (1998) on long-run forecasting in cointegrated systems to multicointegrated systems. For the forecast evaluation we consider several loss functions, each of which has a particular interpretation in the context of stock-flow models where multicointegration typically occurs. A loss function based on a standard mean square forecast error (MSFE) criterion focuses on the forecast errors of the flow variables alone. Likewise, a loss function based on the triangular representation of cointegrated systems (suggested by Christoffersen and Diebold) considers forecast errors associated with changes in both stock (modelled through the cointegrating restrictions) and flow variables. We suggest a new loss function which is based on the triangular representation of multicointegrated systems which further penalizes deviations from the long-run relationship between the levels of stock and flow variables as well as changes in the flow variables. Among other things, we show that if one is concerned with all possible long-run relations between stock and flow variables, this new loss function entails high and increasing forecasting gains compared to both the standard MSFE criterion and Christoffersen and Diebold?s criterion. The paper demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting loss functions in forecast evaluation of models involving stock and flow variables."

      "Recent experience shows that under certain conditions it can be assumed that de-mand for luxury goods is partly abnormal. To tackle the problem whether they can and should be taxed we (a) show that a positive slope of demand is possible by distinguishing snob and network benefits, (b) demonstrate that a willingness to pay systematically lower than the equilibrium price can be explained by false trading procedures resulting (c) from the distinction between sequential and repetitive purchases. Concerning the absolute size of excess burden, a luxury tax should be levied on goods with a high elasticity of demand, but according to the relative criterion under certain (realistic) conditions low ratios may be realized by taxing goods with a high or a low elasticity. Conducting a sensitivity analysis, we conclude that in taxing luxuries there is a high risk of generating just the opposite of what was originally intended."

      "It is increasingly clear that price competition is escalating in the market for higher education. We attempt to understand how price competition would work in higher education and explore the likely long run equilibrium structure of prices in that context. We draw inferences using both microeconomic theory and historical parallels found in the market for graduate education. Our analysis suggests that negative prices are likely to prevail at the wealthiest colleges and universities. Using data from IPEDS we estimate the resulting distribution of prices and school quality. While price competition may increase attendance by low income students at the wealthiest colleges and universities, it is unclear how they will fare at schools with middling wealth and resources. Further, schools with less accumulated wealth will be particularly vulnerable to any ensuing price competition. While our conclusions must be interpreted with caution, they do suggest some cause for alarm."

      "Croatian farming systems have become more intensive in recent years. There is some evidence of rising NO3-N-levels in ground water. The aim of the paper is to find possible ways of preventing NO3-levels to rise in Croatian farming systems and their implications from the viewpoint of the manager. More specifically the purpose is to 1. Determine whether Croatian farmers exceed profit maximising levels of N-fertiliser use in maize cultivation and possible influence on NO3-N-levels. 2. To estimate the marginal abatement cost (MAC) at farm level of reducing NO3-N leaching through following economic instruments: a tax on optimal N-doses, a product tax and a Nfertiliser quota, all instruments corresponding to the same abatement level. Based on N-response experiments from field trials for maize N-response curves were derived. A sample of 20 family farms was used to calculate intensity, nutrient content in manure and the prices paid for N and obtained for maize. Profit maximising doses from the field trials were compared with nutrient use on farms. An effluent production function was estimated based on experiments with NO3-N contents in lysimeter water for the same treatments as in the N-response experiments. The results indicate that farmers use higher than optimal levels of N-fertilisers, if the technology and conditions of experimental fields could be applied on the farms and if manure is accounted for. Neglecting the N-content of the manure shows close to optimal nutrient levels. At profit maximising levels the NO3-N level is approximately 14 mg NO3-N/l (62 mg NO3/l) or clearly higher that the critical level stipulated by the nitrate directive (11.3 mg NO3- N/l or 50 mg NO3/l). If the N-content in the manure is taken into account the estimated NO3-N/l level in groundwater is about twice higher than the critical level stipulated by the Nitrate Directive. Through any of the three instruments a 76% NO3- leaching reduction could be obtained. However, it was concluded the quota has the lowest MAC (4.08 ?/mg NO3-N/l or 0.92 ?/mg NO3/l), followed by the N-fertiliser tax (16.16 ?/mg NO3-N/l or 3.65 ?/mg NO3/l) and the product tax in third place (41.25 ?/mg NO3-N/l or 9.32 ?/mg NO3/l). Management practices that may increase yield level and correspondingly NO3-leaching in the short and long run were identified. One way to achieve a quick improvement would be a system of cross compliance stipulating a code of good agricultural practices."

      "We analyse the extent of intergenerational transmission through parental capital, ethnic capital and neighbourhood effects on several aspects of the school-to-work transition of 2 nd generation immigrants and young ethnic Danes. The main findings are that parental capital has strong positive effects on the probability of completing a qualifying education and on the entry into the labour market, but it has a much smaller impact on the duration of the first employment spell and on the wage level. Growing up in neighbourhoods with a high concentration of immigrants is associated with negative labour market prospects both for young natives and 2 nd generation immigrants."

      "The tremendous development of an easy access to computational power within the last 30 years has led to the widespread use of numerical approaches in almost all scientific disciplines. The first generation of simulation models was rather focused on stylized empirical phenomena. With agent-based modelling, however, the trade-off between simplicity in modelling and taking into account the complexity of the socio-economic reality has been enhanced to a large extent. This paper serves as a basic instruction on how to model qualitative change using an agent-based modelling procedure. The necessity to focus on qualitative change is discussed, agent-based modelling is explained and finally an example is given to show the basic simplicity in modelling."

      "This study addresses the question: Are workers who hold a university degree increasingly filling job openings meant for people with lower levels of schooling? It focuses on Portugal, where the higher education system has been expanding at a fast pace and the share of university graduates in total labour force has been increasing, but where the unemployment rate for such workers has also been increasing. The analysis relies on a remarkable dataset covering the entire workforce in manufacturing and services private sectors, to implement the conceptual framework developed by Gottschalk and Hansen (2003). Results indicate that the university wage premium increased and the proportion of university graduates working in non-university jobs declined sharply over time. Therefore, no support is found for the skepticism over investment in higher education. Results are consistent with the idea that skillbiased technological progress taking place in some sectors raises the productivity of workers with higher schooling levels, thus raising their wages, which attracts new workers with high qualifications."

Viewing bond ratings as predicted probabilities of default, we consider partial orderings among competing probability forecasters and show that Moody's and S&P cannot be ordered according to any of these. Therefore, the relative performance of the agencies depends crucially on the way in which probability predictions are compared."

      "The European Unions's task of providing Trans-European Networks (TENs) in transportation, communications and energy transmission which has been enacted by the treaty of Maastricht, is not confined to internal networks in the EU. Since 1994 this task has been widened so as to give support to the economies in transition (EIT) in Central and Eastern Europe that have applied for EU membership. These actions are taking place in a variety of different fields. Transport infrastructure upgrading is initiated both in general and with respect to specific links between the EU and the EIT. The international community is supporting network upgrading in all Baltic Rim EIT. Specific infrastructure measures refer to the Pan-European \"Crete Corridors\", i.e. the links between EU members and associated EIT. Other \"hardware\" measures are related to the construction of border stations or the promotion of telematics in the whole Baltic Sea Region in order to facilitate freight traffic. On the \"software\" side, TEN initiatives have been enacted to harmonize infrastructure cross-border planning, in particular for Crete Corridors' supervising committees, to account for network externalities. If one widens the narrow definition of infrastructure to institutions, the adjustment of EITs' transport regulatory systems to EU regulations and competition policy can also be subsumed under the heading of TENs. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relative importance of the various measures taken in the course of the TEN initiative in the field of transport for economic development of the EIT on the Eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. The paper considers these actual approaches of European transport policy as well as the needs of the EIT. Though missing infrastructure links and insufficient capacities are more visible, it turns out that \"software\" problems (both from the sphere of regulatory regimes and from administrative procedures) seem to be the most pressing obstacles to transport and trade in the Baltic Rim. The paper discusses the pros and cons of the various TEN components in transport from the perspective of fiscal federalism and of regional development aid for the EIT. Furthermore it refers to issues of modal split, in particular with respect to Russia (for which the Baltic Rim is an important transit point), and to intermodal competition between land transport and the Baltic sea lane."

      "A small number of recent empirical studies for several countries has reported the intriguing finding that the ?advantage? previously enjoyed by men in respect of training incidence and reported in earlier work in the literature has been reversed. The present paper explores the sources of the gender differential in training incidence using Labour Force Survey data, updating previous U.K. studies and providing further insights into the above phenomenon. The results suggest that the greater part of the ?gap? typically relates to differences in characteristics, among which the most important relate to occupation, industry and sector (public/private)."

      "Recent empirical literature has shown that the determination of intergovernmental grants is highly influenced by the political bargaining power of the recipient states. In these models federal politicians are assumed to buy the support of state voters, state politicians and state interest groups by providing grants. In this paper we provide evidence that the fiscal referendum reduces the reliance of states on matching grants received from the central government and thus the possibility of state interest groups and state bureaucrats to obtain more grants. If referendums are available, voters serve as a hard budget constraint."

      "Economic models of household behavior typically yield the prediction that increases in schooling levels and wage rates of married women lead to increases in their labor supply and reductions in fertility. In Italy, as well as in other Southern European countries, low labor market participation rates of married women are observed together with low birth rates. Our proposed explanation for this apparent anomaly involves the Italian institutional structure, particularly as reflected in rigidities and imperfections in the labor market and characteristics of the publicly-funded child care system. These rigidities tend to simultaneously increase the costs of having children and to discourage the labor market participation of married women. We analyze a model of labor supply and fertility, using panel data from the Bank of Italy which have been merged with regional data describing the available opportunities in each sample household?s environment. The empirical results show that the availability of child care and part time work increase both the probability of working and having a child. Policies which would provide more flexible working hours choices and greater child care availability would aid in reducing the financial burden of children."

      "In this paper, I offer a theoretical explanation of the robust gender differences in educational achievement distributions of school children. I consider a shot cheap talk game with two different types of senders (biased teachers and fair teachers), two types of receivers (normal and special pupils) and uncertainty about the sender type on the side of the receiver. I demonstrate that the group of pupils who, in expectation, get either too much or too little encouragement will have less top achievers and a lower average achievement than the group of pupils who get a more accurate feedback message, even if the prior talent distribution is the same for both groups of pupils."

      "Gem\u00e4\u00df der klassischen \u00f6konomischen Theorie der Kriminalit\u00e4t sollte ein Anstieg der erwarteten Strafe (also des Produktes aus Strafwahrscheinlichkeit und Strafma\u00df) eine Reduktion der Kriminalit\u00e4t bewirken. In der empirischen Analyse gestaltet sich ein Test dieser \u00fcberschaubar anmutenden Hypothese als \u00e4u\u00dferst komplex. ?Kriminalit\u00e4t? gliedert sich in eine Vielzahl von Deliktgruppen und die Operationalisierung von ?Strafwahrscheinlichkeit? durchl\u00e4uft im rechtsstaatlichen System die Handlungen und Entscheidungen der Institutionen ?Polizei?, ?Staatsanwaltschaft? und ?Gericht? und variiert in den Zahlen zu Aufkl\u00e4rungs-, Anklage- und Verurteilungsquoten sowie in Entscheidungen \u00fcber Geld-, Haft- und Bew\u00e4hrungsstrafen. Ferner ist es entscheidend, ob eine Verurteilung nach allgemeinem Strafrecht oder nach Jugendstrafrecht erfolgt. \u00dcblicherweise wird in der empirischen Kriminalit\u00e4tsforschung immer nur ein Teil dieser Zusammenh\u00e4nge gleichzeitig ber\u00fccksichtigt. Mit der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es gelungen, dieses Defizit unter Verwendung einer aus Bundesl\u00e4nderdaten des Zeitraums 1977?2001 der Polizeilichen Kriminalstatistik und der Strafverfolgungsstatistik aufgebauten Datenbank zu \u00fcberwinden. Auf Grundlage dieser Datenbank wird ein umfassendes System von Strafverfolgungsindikatoren entwickelt, das sodann unter Verwendung panel\u00f6konometrischer Sch\u00e4tzverfahren in Beziehung zum Kriminalit\u00e4tsaufkommen von sechs wichtigen Deliktgruppen gesetzt wird. Das Ergebnis, dass zumeist negativ signifikante Effekte f\u00fcr die Aufkl\u00e4rungs- und Verurteilungsquote aber zumeist nur insignifikante Koeffizienten f\u00fcr die Indikatoren von Strafart und -h\u00f6he gefunden werden, legt nahe, dass insbesondere von den fr\u00fchen Stufen des Strafverfolgungsprozesses eine abschreckende Wirkung entfaltet wird. Die ermittelten Effektst\u00e4rken werden schlie\u00dflich dazu genutzt, die opferspezifische Schadensreduktion einer Versch\u00e4rfung des Strafverfolgungsprozesses abzusch\u00e4tzen. Demnach w\u00fcrde eine permanente Erh\u00f6hung aller Indikatoren um 10% zu einem j\u00e4hrlichen R\u00fcckgang der Opferkosten von mindestens 250 Millionen \u2013 f\u00fchren.",
      "According to the economic theory of crime, a rise in expected punishment (the product of probability and severity of punishment) results in a reduction of crime due to deterrence. What appears to be a simple and straightforward hypotheses turns out to be a demanding task for empirical examination because ?crime? is composed of many different offence categories and expected punishment is influenced by the actions and decisions of different institutions such as police, public prosecutor?s office and the courts and, thus, varies with respect to clearance and conviction rate as well as decisions regarding type (fine, probation, imprisonment) and ?quantity? (length of prison sentence and size of fine) of punishment. Moreover, it makes a difference whether offenders are subject to general or juvenile criminal law. Usually, empirical analyses of crime/deterrence take simultaneous account of only a fraction of the items detailed above. In order to overcome this shortcoming the author has established a unique database combining information from different sources of official judicial statistics covering the German states for the period 1977?2001. Building on this database a comprehensive system of criminal prosecution indicators is derived and subsequently related to the incidence of six major offence categories using panel-econometrics. Revealing many negative significant effects for clearance and conviction rates but mostly insignificant coefficients for indicators of type and ?quantity? of punishment the estimation results suggest that deterrence is mainly exerted at the initial levels of the criminal prosecution process. Finally, the econometric estimates are used in order to assess cost reductions for crime victims from increases in the severity of criminal prosecution. Thus, intensifying criminal prosecution permanently by 10 percent would reduce victims? costs by at least ? 250 million p.a."

      "The adequate role of Darwinist concepts in evolutionary economics has long been a contentious issue. The controversy has recently been rekindled and modified by the position of \"Universal Darwinism\", most prominently favored by Geoffrey Hodgson and Thorbj\u00f8rn Knudsen. They argue that the ontology of all evolutionary systems accords to the basic Darwinist scheme of variation, selection and inheritance. This paper focuses on the emerging application of the Universal Darwinist framework to the analysis of market competition and industrial evolution and gauges its usefulness for organizing an evolutionary approach to industrial economics. Drawing on both a theoretical discussion and recent empirical findings, it argues that selection and inheritance concepts narrowly construed after the biological example are of limited help in studying markets and industries. As an alternative to the \"topdown\" approach of Universal Darwinism, \"bottom-up\" causal theories are suggested that explain how the interplay of descent, experience and learning shapes the competitive performance of firms in the evolution of industries."

      "Der Beitrag untersucht die Bedeutung von Zuwanderung f\u00fcr die langfristige Entwicklung \u00f6ffentlicher Haushalte in Deutschland. Mit Hilfe der Generationenbilanzierung werden die Nettosteuerzahlungen von Zuwanderern von ihrer Ankunft im Aufnahmeland bis an ihr Lebensende gesch\u00e4tzt. Wenn k\u00fcnftige Einwanderer der heute in Deutschland lebenden Ausl\u00e4nderbev\u00f6lkerung \u00e4hneln, ist der Gesamtbeitrag der Zuwanderung zu den \u00f6ffentlichen Haushalten eindeutig positiv. Immigration w\u00e4re daher ein geeignetes Instrument, in einer alternden Gesellschaft steigende Steuerlasten f\u00fcr die einheimische Bev\u00f6lkerung zu verringern. Eine aktive Einwanderungspolitik, die hoch Qualifizierte selektiert und die Integration der Zuwanderer in den Arbeitsmarkt unterst\u00fctzt, vergr\u00f6\u00dfert die positiven Wirkungen auf die Steuerlast der einheimischen Bev\u00f6lkerung. Allerdings kann selbst hohe Zuwanderung gut ausgebildeter Erwerbspersonen die von einer alternden Bev\u00f6lkerung ausgel\u00f6sten generationalen Umverteilungsprozesse nur teilweise aufheben.",
      "The paper employs generational accounting to analyze the intertemporal fiscal impact of immigration to Germany. Generational accounts for native and alien residents are distinguished to assess what might be the lifetime net tax payments of prospective immigrants after arrival. Supposed future immigrants resemble the current migrant population in Germany, the fiscal externality on the incumbent population due to immigration is found positive and large. Further, immigration probably reduces generational redistribution through demographic aging even if migrants assimilate slowly fiscally. However, while selective immigration policy could raise the average migrant surplus to the intertemporal government budget, it cannot restore fiscal sustainability."

      "In this paper, the inter-industry wage structure in West Germany and USA is compared using the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), the German Mikrozensus (MZ), the American Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the American Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1984 to 1996. Using a sample of prime age full-time employed males from the respective datasets, it is shown that the structure of wages has remained remarkably stable over this time period, and that the German structure resembles the American structure strongly. Cross-sectional and panel results are provided for both countries. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in the random effects panel estimations reduces the industry wage dispersion by about half. Thus, although the MZ and the CPS provide very large sample sizes, panel data sets (although typically smaller in sample size) are still very important in getting at the essence of the industry wage structure and the absolute level of industry wage dispersion. In calculating inter-industry wage differentials as deviations from a hypothetical employment-share weighted mean, we use the methodology as described in Haisken-DeNew and Schmidt (1997) of calculating exact differentials and their respective standard errors."

      "This paper studies the formation of human capital and its transmission across generations when premature adult mortality is a salient feature of the demographic landscape, either permanently or in the form of a long-period wave that follows the outbreak of an epidemic. We establish several threshold properties of the model, for such a shock can severely retard economic growth, even to the point of leading to an economic collapse. Premature adult mortality may exacerbate inequality under nuclear family arrangements. Pooling mortality risks with equal treatment of all children may fend off, or even induce, a collapse, depending on the initial conditions and the size and duration of the shock. Awareness campaigns may also trigger a collapse by introducing undesirable expectational feedbacks."

      "This paper is motivated by the idea that the enlargement of the European Union is only one part of an overall process, known as economic integration, which characterizes the involvement of European economies into the global division of labor. Therefore, the paper aims at providing a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact of economic integration on employment and labor market dynamics in current EU-member and candidate countries. The ultimate aim of this analysis is the provision of forecasts for future labor market developments in the context of EU-enlargement. To this end, we investigate this nexus not only on an economy-wide level, but analyze whether the impact of integration varies for different sectors (automotive and financial services) of the economy. The estimation results suggest that future integration processes lead to an increase of economywide employment in the accession countries and a small, if any, rise in this outcome variable in the current EU-countries. Moreover, it could be expected that unemployment rates in the accession countries will decline somewhat, whereas those of the current EU-member states will probably experience an increase. Finally, it is very likely that the structure of employment will shift further towards a higher share of service sector employment."

      "Recent literature has emphasized that redistributive grant systems may tend to internalize fiscal externalities arising from tax competition. This paper further explores the conditions under which local grant systems enforced by the state government will enhance efficiency. A system of redistributive grants among governments is introduced into a standard model of tax competition. This basic model is then extended in order to allow for variations in the government objectives at the state level. A subsequent empirical analysis of local tax policy exploits the experience with local fiscal revenue sharing in Germany. The results suggest that attempts of state level governments to extract fiscal resources from the local revenue sharing system exert an upward pressure on tax rates."

Key issues concern the precise definition of coercion for individuals and in the aggregate, its difference from redistribution, and its incorporation into normative analysis. We explore modifications to traditional rules for optimal fiscal policy in the presence of coercion constraints and determine the degree of coercion implied by traditional social planning. The paper maps the trade-off between social welfare and aggregate coercion and explores its implications for normative policy and the comparative evaluation of institutions, including competitive democracy."

This study demonstrates that 19th century stature and BMIs were significant in Texas occupation selection; however, stature and BMIs were not significant in the decision to participate in the Southwest's labor market. In the post-bellum south, labor markets were segregated, and white laborers were at a distinct occupational and social advantage relative to their black counterparts. It is documented here that the probability of being farmers and unskilled workers were comparable by race. However, whites had greater access to white-collar and skilled occupations."

      "We compare patterns of movements into and out of poverty by children in Britain and Germany using data from the British Household Panel Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel for the period 1992-7. Compared to Germany, in Britain poverty persistence is greater, and poverty exit rates in particular are lower. In both countries poverty is particularly persistent among children in lone parent households and households with a non-working head. Events such as family formation and dissolution, and changes in household labour market attachment are associated with child poverty transitions in the direction expected, and in both countries. However a large fraction of the observed poverty transitions are not accounted for by these events.",
      "Wir vergleichen die Muster der Armutsdynamik bei Kindern in Gro\u00dfbritannien und Deutschland anhand der Daten der British Household Panel Survey und des Sozio-\u00f6konomischen Panels f\u00fcr den Zeitraum 1992-1997. Im Vergleich zu Deutschland ist in Gro\u00dfbritannien die Verweildauer in Armut l\u00e4nger und die Armutsausstiegsraten sind wesentlich niedriger. In beiden L\u00e4ndern bleiben vor allem Kinder in Alleinerziehenden-Haushalten und Haushalten mit nicht-erwerbst\u00e4tigem Haushaltsvorstand dauerhaft arm. Ereignisse wie Familiengr\u00fcndung und Trennung sowie Ver\u00e4nderungen im Erwerbsverhalten erh\u00f6hen in beiden L\u00e4ndern das Armutsrisiko von Kindern. Aber auch diese Ereignisse k\u00f6nnen einen gro\u00dfen Anteil der beobachteten \u00dcberg\u00e4nge in Armut nicht erkl\u00e4ren."

      "Der Ausbau von Ganztagsschulen genie\u00dft derzeit \u2013 u.a. auf Grund des schlechten Abschneidens deutscher Sch\u00fcler bei der PISA-Studie \u2013 hohe Priorit\u00e4t in der politischen Agenda. In diesem Beitrag soll untersucht werden, wie sich der Ausbau von Ganztagsschulen auf die Erwerbsbeteiligung von M\u00fcttern mit Kindern im Grundschulalter auswirken wird. Hierf\u00fcr sch\u00e4tzen wir ein strukturelles Arbeitsangebotsmodell, in dem die Kosten der Nachmittagsbetreuung explizit ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. Unsere Politiksimulationen zeigen, dass im Fall einer fl\u00e4chendeckenden Versorgung mit Ganztagsschulen erhebliche Arbeitsangebotseffekte zu erwarten w\u00e4ren: Die Erwerbsbeteiligung der M\u00fctter w\u00fcrde um 4 Prozentpunkte in West- und um einen Prozentpunkt in Ostdeutschland steigen. Ihre durchschnittliche Arbeitszeit w\u00fcrde sich um mehr als 16 Prozent in West- und um 5 Prozent in Ostdeutschland erh\u00f6hen. Ein realistischeres Szenario, das derzeit im Rahmen des Bundesinvestitionsprogramms ?Zukunft Bildung und Betreuung? implizit angestrebt wird, ist die bundesweite Erh\u00f6hung der Versorgung mit Ganztagsschulpl\u00e4tzen auf 30 Prozent. In diesem Fall w\u00fcrde sich nach unserer Berechnung die Partizipationsquote in Westdeutschland um knapp einen Prozentpunkt erh\u00f6hen, die durchschnittliche Arbeitszeit w\u00fcrde um 4 Prozent steigen. In Ostdeutschland ist mit niedrigeren Effekten zu rechnen, da das dort vorhandene Angebot an Hortpl\u00e4tzen und Ganztagsschulen bereits heute eine Erwerbst\u00e4tigkeit beider Elternteile eher erm\u00f6glicht als in Westdeutschland."

      "A deferred annuity typically includes an option-like right for the policyholder. At the end of the deferment period, he may either choose to receive annuity payouts, calculated based on a mortality table agreed to at contract inception, or receive the accumulated capital as a lump sum. Considering stochastic mortality improvements, such an option could be of substantial value. Whenever mortality improves less than originally expected, the policyholder will choose the lump sum and buy an annuity on the market granting him a better price. If, however, mortality improves more than expected, the policyholder will choose to retain the deferred annuity. We use a realistically calibrated life-cycle consumption/saving/asset allocation model and calculate the welfare gains of deferred annuities under stochastic Lee- Carter mortality. Our results are relevant both for individual retirement planning and for policymakers, especially if legislation makes annuitization, at least in part, mandatory. Our results also indicate the maximal willingness to pay for the mortality option inherent in deferred annuities, which is of relevance to insurance pricing."

We test this hypothesis in a sample of 52 countries over the period 1977-2000, using government spending, social and welfare spending and deficit as policy choice variables using panel data estimation techniques. We are unable to find significant differences in the behavior of term-limited and non term-limited chief executives. This is in contrast with some previous empirical results based on U.S. states and international data."

      "Similar to Chile in the 1990s, Slovenia has introduced an unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) on financial credits in 1995. We find that the URR has not been effective in reducing overall inflows of foreign capital. Hence, the gain in monetary autonomy has been limited. While the overall structure of capital inflows has not differed decidedly from that of other transition economies, Slovenia has raised less short-term bank credit from abroad. Moreover, there are indications that the volatility of exchange rates has declined after the imposition of the URR while the volatility of capital flows has increased."

      "The internal density of a local network is said to increase the regionspecific knowledge-stock and might lead to a comparative advantage. However, it might also lead to a lock-in situation, if local trajectories are directed towards inferior solutions. Accordingly it is argued that successful clusters are characterised by the existence of gatekeepers, i.e. actors that generate novelty by drawing on local and external knowledge. We attempt to answer questions related to the role and characteristics of gatekeepers within regional innovation systems by applying social network analysis based on patent data for four East-German regions. The regional networks appear to be significantly different with respect to the overall degree of interaction and with respect to their relative outward orientation. Concerning the characteristics of gatekeepers, we find that size does not play the major role for being a gatekeeper. It is rather absorptive capacity that matters for gatekeepers. It also shows that public research organisations serve the functions of a gatekeeper to a higher degree than private actors."

      "In dem Beitrag wird die Infrastrukturausstattung der neuen Bundesl\u00e4nder vorwiegend auf Grund einer Auswertung vorhandener Fachliteratur untersucht. Der Zustand der Infrastruktur in Ostdeutschland zum Zeitpunkt der Vereinigung 1990 war bekannterma\u00dfen sehr schlecht. Der nach mehr als zehnj\u00e4hriger Aufbaut\u00e4tigkeit aktuell verbleibende Nachholbedarf d\u00fcrfte am gr\u00f6\u00dften im Stra\u00dfenwesen sein. Hier wird es vor allem darauf ankommen, die geplanten gro\u00dfr\u00e4umigen Autobahnanbindungen f\u00fcr Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sowie Teile Sachsen-Anhalts und Th\u00fcringens fertig zu stellen und ferner die zahlreichen M\u00e4ngel im Netz der Bundes-, Landes- und Gemeindestra\u00dfen z\u00fcgig weiter zu beheben. Bei der Eisenbahn geht es insbesondere um die ICE-Neubaustrecke N\u00fcrnberg-Erfurt sowie um noch ausstehende Verbesserungen am bestehenden Netz, soweit die Nachfrage nach Verkehrsleistungen dies gerechtfertigt erscheinen l\u00e4sst. Der geringste Nachholbedarf besteht im Telekommunikationssektor und \u2013 nach Realisierung aktueller Planungen \u2013 im Bereich der Flugh\u00e4fen.",
      "The paper analyses the infrastructure provision in East Germany mainly by an examination of existing literature. At the time of German unification 1990, infrastructure in East Germany was in a very bad condition. After more than ten years of rebuilding, most of the remaining need for infrastructure investments is probably in the road sector. Therefore, the planned new motorway connections to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as well as to Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia will have to be completed and, furthermore, numerous defects of regional and local road networks will continuously have to be repaired. In the railway sector, the high-speed route Nuremberg-Erfurt as well as improvements in the existing network (as far as they are justified by the prospective transport demand) are on the agenda. The least need for investments is left in the telecommunications and - after realization of current investment plans - in the airport sectors."

      "In this paper, we present a matching model with adverse selection that explains why flows into and out of unemployment are much lower in Europe compared to North America, while employment-to-employment flows are similar in the two continents. In the model, firms use discretion in terms of whom to fire and, thus, low quality workers are more likely to be dismissed than high quality workers. Moreover, as hiring and firing costs increase, firms find it more costly to hire a bad worker and, thus, they prefer to hire out of the pool of employed job seekers rather than out of the pool of the unemployed, who are more likely to turn out to be `lemons'. We use microdata for Spain and the U.S. and find that the ratio of the job finding probability of the unemployed to the job finding probability of employed job seekers was smaller in Spain than in the U.S.. Furthermore, using U.S. data, we find that the discrimination of the unemployed increased over the 1980's in those states that raised firing costs by introducing exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine."

      "Simple Malthusian models remain an important tool for understanding pre-modern demographic systems and their connection to the economy. But most recent literature has lost sight of the institutional context for demographic behavior that lay at the heart of Malthus's own analysis. This paper estimates a short-run version of a Malthusian model for two W\u00fcrttemberg communities from 1646 to 1870. W\u00fcrttemberg differed institutionally from the northwest European societies analyzed in previous studies. The impact of institutional differences shows clearly in differing demographic reactions to economic shocks. Mortality was less sensitive to shocks than one would expect, while nuptiality was especially sensitive."

However, sole proprietorships and partnerships can opt for a preferential tax rate of 28,25 per cent for retained profits (\u00a734a EStG-E). If they do so, profits are taxed again upon distribution. Using corporate finance tools we analyse in detail whether or not the option is favourable. However, these tools do nut suffice since the new tax regime is too complicated. Costs of capital cannot be calculated explicitly any more, but we derive exact implicit characterisations. Concrete numerical examples are also provided."

Our results, which range between 56% and 66%, indicate a rebound that is substantially larger than obtained in other studies, calling into question the efficacy of recently implemented measures in the European Union targeted at technological innovations in the automotive sector."

      "NGO aid is still widely believed to be superior to official aid (ODA). However, the incentives of NGOs to excel and target aid to the poor and deserving are increasingly disputed. We contribute to the emerging literature on the allocation of NGO aid by performing panel Tobit estimations for Swiss NGOs. The analysis offers new insights in two major regards: First, we cover the allocation of both self-financed and officially co-financed aid for a large panel of NGOs and recipient countries. Second, by classifying each NGO according to its financing structure, we address the unresolved question of whether financial dependence on the government impairs the targeting of NGO aid. It turns out that NGOs mimic the state as well as NGO peers. Officially refinanced NGOs are more inclined to imitate the allocation of ODA. However, the degree of financial dependence does not affect the poverty orientation of NGO aid and the incentives of NGOs to engage in easier environments. The allocation of self-financed aid differs in several respects from the allocation of officially co-financed aid, including the role of financial dependence for imitating the state and herding among NGOs."

      "This article reports the results of a simple bargaining experiment on the ultimatum-revenge game. The game enables to differentiate between fairness that is stimulated by intentional based motives, distributional motives, and fairness considerations that mix both motives. The laboratory experiments indicate considerable heterogeneity of motives. A majority of subjects seem to combine both motives. However, the composition of the mix is subject to a transition, which can be formalized by the principle of appropriateness. In contrast to contemporary reciprocity models, this approach suggests that mildly unkind treatments are responded mildly unkindly, while strong unkindness leads to harsh reactions."

      "Not only the level of aggregate unemployment but also the properties of its dynamics are an important topic in macroeconomics and labor economics. Several models like e.g. matching models with endogenous job destruction explicitly predict an asymmetric pattern in the evolution of unemployment, whereas linear models with Gaussian innovations preclude such dynamics. This paper applies several tests for asymmetry to aggregate British, German and US unemployment data to assess the relevance of asymmetries and compare the testing procedures. The results indicate that unemployment increases more quickly than it decreases, which is consistent with the pattern implied by matching models with endogenous job destruction."

      "The paper discusses a number of threats to the financial sustainability of social spending: increased internationalization of national economies, gradually higher relative costs of producing a number of human services, the ?graying? of the population, slower productivity growth in the private sector, low employment rates, and various types of disincentive effects related to the welfare state itself, including moral hazard. I argue that threats from gradually rising costs of providing human services and disincentive effects of welfare-state arrangements, in particular moral hazard and benefit dependency, are more difficult to deal with than the other threats. I also discuss the choice between ad hoc policy reforms and automatic adjustment mechanisms, delegated to administrative bodies, for dealing with these threats."

      "The paper discusses the decisions on the CAP in the context of the Berlin summit. In a rather broad perspective the agricultural sectoral and related objectives are analyzed for their consistency and compatability with higher ranking societal objectives. The policies' allocational and distributional consequences are assessed in a qualitative manner by comparing them with a hypothetical first-best policy. The analysis focusses on the distortions in land allocation between agriculture, forestry and environmental purposes as well as on distributional consequences, taking into account the envisaged eastern enlargement. Among the consequences are excessive budget outlays and high economic rents for landowners, who are increasingly no active farmers themselves. Finally, problems of implementing a liberal CAP reform are discussed."

      "What role do community norms play in the diffusion and persistence of new organizational practices? We explore this question through an examination of the widespread practice of wage arrears, the late and non-payment of wages, in Russia during the 1990s. Existing research on wage arrears most often examines this practice as a means of flexible wage adjustment under difficult economic conditions. We develop an alternative theory that explains wage arrears through their acceptance as a legitimate form of organizational behavior within local communities. Our empirical analysis finds some support for the neoclassical position that wage arrears reflect adjustment to negative shocks, but this perspective fails to account for a number of important facts, including a high level of arrears among apparently successful firms. In contrast, our results find strong support for the institutional perspective. The statistical analysis demonstrates powerful and robust community effects both in firm adoption of this practice, controlling for firm performance, liquidity, and fixed firm effects, and in workers? reaction to arrears, through their quit (exit) and strike (voice) behavior."

      "Since the 1950s, there has been a steady decentralization of entry-level jobs towards the suburbs of American cities, while racial minorities ?and particularly blacks? have remained in city centers. In this context, the spatial mismatch hypothesis argues that because the residential locations of minorities are disconnected from suburban job opportunities, lowskilled minorities residing in inner cities face adverse labor market outcomes. However, the reason why distance to jobs may be harmful to minorities has long remained unclear while the abundant but essentially empirical literature on spatial mismatch has led to much controversy. The present work presents the main stylized facts associated with spatial mismatch and reviews the main theoretical models that started to emerge in the late 1990s."

Hierbei sind folgende Fragestellungen von besonderem Interesse: Ist mit einer Verst\u00e4rkung des internationalen Branchenwettbewerbs zu rechnen? Wie positioniert sich Deutschland? Welche Rolle spielen Absatz-, Forschungs- und Produktionsbedingungen in den Erweiterungs- und Schwellenl\u00e4ndern? Welche Implikationen folgen f\u00fcr die deutsche Technologie- und Standortpolitik?

      "I study a model where Information Technology, while typically increasing overall inequality, is likely to harm some people at intermediate and high levels of the distribution of income but to benefit people at the bottom. Within a given occupation it may harm some workers while benefitting others; and it may either reduce or increase the proportion of knowledge workers in employment. In my model, knowledge (in a broad sense) is an input into the production function of human capital, and is also a ??quality?? good in the sense that one cannot buy it from several low-quality producers instead of one high-quality one. People differ in their exogenous ability and ability is complementary with the quality of the knowledge input in the production of human capital. An improvement in IT is modelled as an increase in the number of people who can buy knowledge from one producer. I show that the economy organizes itself in a succession of clusters of ability levels, called ??knowledge ladders??, where a member of a given ladder buys knowledge from a worker in the subsequent ladder and sells it to a worker of the preceding ladder. The return to human capital increases as one moves up the knowledge ladder. The economic mechanism considered here rests on the view that IT makes the acquisition of knowledge cheaper, which intensifies competition among workers specialized in knowledge production. Those who lose in such competition end up displaced to occupations with a lower knowledge intensity; their wages fall, which reduces inequality between them and the least skilled. Those who win can spread their ability over a larger market and because of that enjoy a larger increase in wages than the least skilled, which tends to increase inequality. The least skilled do not participate in this competition, as they are not specialized in knowledge production; they gain in absolute terms because of their cheaper access to knowledge."

      "Audretsch and Fritsch (2002) proposed two explanations for the mixed evidence regarding the relationship between new firm formation and regional development. Firstly, they found evidence for the existence of long time lags needed before the main effects of new firm formation on employment change become evident. Secondly, they suggested that regions may be characterized by different growth regimes in which new firms and entrepreneurship assume different roles and accordingly lead to different effects. This paper reports the results of re-estimating the main relationships investigated by Audretsch and Fritsch (2002) in a somewhat different way. One main difference is that we now have information on a longer time-period available and have chosen shorter time intervals for the analysis. This enabled us to investigate the transition between different types of growth regimes in further detail. Furthermore, our analysis is not on the level of planning regions but on the level of districts (?Kreise?) and we have explicitly accounted for spatial autocorrelation in the analysis, which turns out to be highly relevant.",
      "Audretsch und Fritsch (2002) haben zwei Erkl\u00e4rungen f\u00fcr die unklare empirische Evidenz hinsichtlich des Einflusses von Gr\u00fcndungen auf die Regionalentwicklung vorgeschlagen. Erstens fanden sie Hinweise darauf, dass wesentliche Effekte der Gr\u00fcndungen auf die Arbeitsplatzentwicklung erst mit gro\u00dfer Zeitverz\u00f6gerung wirksam werden. Und zweitens vermuten sie, dass Regionen durch unterschiedliche Wachstumsregime gekennzeichnet sind in denen Gr\u00fcndungen und Entrepreneurship unterschiedliche Rollen spielen und sie entsprechend unterschiedliche Wirkungen entfalten. Dieser Aufsatz berichtet von erneuten empirischen Analysen der von Audretsch und Fritsch (2002) untersuchten Beziehungen. Ein wesentlicher Unterschied besteht darin, dass Daten \u00fcber einen l\u00e4ngeren Zeitraum zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Gleichzeitig wird eine Einteilung in k\u00fcrzere Zeitintervalle gew\u00e4hlt, so dass sich die \u00dcberg\u00e4nge zwischen verschiedenen Typen von Wachstumsregimen eingehender untersuchen lassen. Weiterhin f\u00fchren wir die Analyse auf der Ebene von Kreisen und nicht f\u00fcr Raumordnungsregionen durch. Und wir kontrollieren explizit f\u00fcr r\u00e4umliche Autokorrelation, die sich in den Sch\u00e4tzungen als recht bedeutsam erweist."

      "In this paper, we conduct a pan-European efficiency analysis to investigate the performance of European railways with a particular focus on economies of vertical integration. We test the hypothesis that integrated railways realize economies of scope and, thus, produce railway services with a higher level of efficiency. To determine whether joint or separate production is more efficient, we apply a Data Envelopment Analysis super-efficiency bootstrapping model which relates the efficiency for integrated production to a reference set consisting of separated firms which use a different production technology. We find that for a majority of European railways economies of scope exist."

      "This paper introduces intra- and inter-sectoral technology diffusion via FDI and imports into a recursive-dynamic CGE model for climate policy analyses. It analyzes China's accession to a Post Kyoto emission regime that keeps global emissions from 2012 on constant. Due to ongoing energy efficiency gains, partly stemming from international technology diffusion, China will become a net seller of emission permits and steadily reduce emissions, possibly below their 2004 level until 2030. This will reduce the world CO2 price significantly. The impact of supporting foreign firms and of reducing import tariffs on Chinese welfare will not significantly change when China joins the Post Kyoto regime."

      "Principal-agent theory suggests that a manager should be paid relative to a benchmark that captures the effect of market or sector performance on the firm's own performance. Recently, it has been argued that we do not observe such indexation in the data because executives can set pay in their own interests, that is, they can enjoy \"pay for luck\" as well as \"pay for performance\". We first show that this argument is flawed. The positive expected return on stock markets reflects compensation for bearing systematic risk. If executives' pay is tied to market movements, they can only expect to receive the market-determined return for risk-bearing. We then reformulate the argument in a more appropriate fashion. If managers can truly influence the nature of their pay, they will seek to have their pay benchmarked only when it is in their interest, namely when the benchmark has fallen. Using a variety of market and industry benchmarks, we find that there is essentially no indexation when the benchmark return is up, but uncover substantial indexation when the benchmark has turned downwards. These empirical results are robust to a variety of alternative hypotheses and robustness checks, and suggest an increase in expected direct compensation of approximately $75,000 for the median executive in our sample, or about 5% of total compensation."

      "In Kusuda [45], we developed equilibrium analysis in security market economy with jump-Wiener information where no finite number of securities can complete markets. Assuming approximately complete markets (Bj\u00f6rk et al.

In this paper, we derive the Consumption-Based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM) using the framework in case of heterogeneous with additively separable utilities (ASUs) and of homogeneous agents with a common stochastic differential utility (SDU). The CCAPM says that the risk premium between a risky security and the nominal-risk-free security can be decomposed into two groups of terms. One is related to the price uctuation of the risky security, and the other is related to that of commodity. Each group can be further decomposed into two terms related to consumption volatility and consumption jump in case of ASUs, and into three terms related to consumption volatility, continuation utility volatility, and jumps of consumption and continuation utility in case of SDU. Next, we present a general equilibrium framework of jump-diffusion option pricing models in each case of heterogeneous agents with CRRA utilities and of homogeneous agents with a common Kreps-Porteus utility. Finally, we construct a general equilibrium version of an affine jump-diffusion model with jump-diffusion volatility for option pricing using the framework."

      "In this paper we investigate the effects of central bank interventions (CBI) in a noise trading model with chartists and fundamentalists. We first estimate a model in which chartists extrapolate past returns and fundamentalists forecast a mean reverting dynamics of the exchange rate towards a fundamental value. Then, we investigate the role of central bank interventions in explaining the switching properties between the two types of agents. We find evidence that in the medium run, interventions increase the proportion of fundamentalists and therefore exert some stabilizing influence on the exchange rate."

      "Politicians seeking reelection need voters to know what they have done for them. Thus, incentives may arise to spend more money where media coverage is higher. We present a simple model to explain the allocation of public spending across jurisdictions contingent on media activity. An incumbent seeking to maximize the probability of reelection will shift more money to jurisdictions where an extra dollar gains more votes because a larger share of the electorate is informed about his policy. This prediction is tested using US data on county-level public spending, Designated Market Areas (DMAs) and location of licensed television stations. Instrumenting for the possible endogeneity of media activity to public spending, 2SLS results confirm a positive effect of media coverage on county-level public spending. Spatial regression rules out the possibility of confounding media effects with spatial autocorrelation."

      "In western industrialized countries men are on average more than twice as active in entrepreneurship as women. Based on data from a recent representative survey of the adult population in Germany this paper uses an empirical model for the decision to become selfemployed to test for differences between women and men in the ceteris paribus impact of several characteristics and attitudes, taking the rare events nature of becoming an entrepreneur into account. Furthermore, a non-parametric approach using Mahalanobisdistance matching of man and woman which are as similar as possible in all characteristics and attitudes but the \"small difference\" is used to investigate the difference in the propensity to become self-employed by gender. A core finding is that the difference between men and women in both the extent and the effect of considering fear of failure to be a reason not to start one's own business is important for the explanation of the gender gap in entrepreneurship."

      "In den modernen Gesellschaften ist die Freizeit eine Dimension des Lebens, die immer mehr an Bedeutung gewinnt. Die Lebensstilforschung vertritt die Ansicht, dass sozio-\u00f6konomische Unterschiede aufgrund der langfristigen Verbesserung der materiellen Lebensumst\u00e4nde an Bedeutung verloren haben und das Freizeitverhalten weitgehend von der sozialen Lage ent-koppelt ist. Dagegen sind Unterschiede in der Gestaltung der freien Zeit nach Ansicht der klassischen Ungleichheitstheorien nach wie vor Ausdruck der sozialen Lage. Die widerstrei-tenden Thesen werden empirisch mit den Daten des Sozio-\u00f6konomischen Panels (SOEP) getestet, indem der Zusammenhang zwischen Freizeitverhalten und sozialstrukturellen Merkmalen f\u00fcr 1990 und 2003 mit Hilfe von Random-Effects-Modellen analysiert wird. Es zeigt sich, dass die klassischen Ungleichheitsmerkmale Einkommen und Bildung neben dem Alter und dem Geschlecht nach wie vor nicht nur wichtige Einflussfaktoren sind, sondern dass im Zeitverlauf sogar eine Zunahme der Bedeutung des Einkommens zu verzeichnen ist. Die These, dass Unterschiede im Freizeitverhalten losgel\u00f6st von der sozialen Lage sind, kann somit nicht best\u00e4tigt werden.",
      "Leisure is an important domain of life in modern societies. To find out who participates in what leisure activities, two different theoretical approaches are available. Classical inequality theories posit that differences in leisure activities are strongly connected with social position. In contrast, lifestyle theory concepts argue that socio-economic differences have lost their impact with the overall rise in living standards and that leisure activities are increasingly in-dependent of socio-economic determinants. With data from the German Socio-Economic Panel study (SOEP) we can empirically test which theoretical concept best describe differ-ences in leisure activities. By using random-effects-models for the years 1990 and 2003, we observe, that individual leisure activities depend strongly on income and education along with age and gender. Over time, the influence of income also increases. In sum, it appears that differences in leisure are indeed still strongly connected with socio-economic status."

      "This paper develops a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to examine the quantitative macroeconomic implications of countercyclical fiscal policy for France, Germany and the UK. The model incorporates real wage rigidity which is the particular market failure justifying policy intervention. We subject the model to productivity shocks and use either government consumption or investment to react to the output gap or the public debt-to-output ratio. If the object of fiscal policy is purely to stabilize output or debt volatility, then our results suggest substantial reductions can be obtained, especially with respect to output. In stark contrast, however, a formal general equilibrium welfare assessment of the volatility implications of these alternative instrument/target combinations reveals the welfare gains from active policy, measured as a share of consumption, to be very modest."

      "This paper analyses the impact of public equity schemes on venture capitalist's incentives to finance start-up enterprises and to support the management teams. In a double-sided moral hazard model, it is shown that experienced venture capitalists, who have already financed start-up enterprises, reduce their intensity of management support under public equity schemes. However, public equity offers inexperienced venture capitalists, who have not yet financed start-up enterprises because of insuf-ficient experience, incentives to enter the venture capital market so that they can start to accumulate experience."

      "This study investigates the role of factors that determine individual employees? and firms? participation in profit sharing schemes. Using a large panel data of Finnish employees for the period 1996-2000 we analyse individual and workplace characteristics that make firms employ profit sharing schemes and workers susceptible of receiving profit sharing bonuses. In particular two links between profit sharing schemes and workers performance have been analysed. First, in looking at profit sharing as an incentive device the results show a positive link between firm size and monitoring costs. Second, we find that younger individuals with higher mean salary and capacity to bear risk are more susceptible to profit sharing schemes. The industrial sector in which the individual is employed is also an important determinant factor."

      "This paper considers the potential impact of welfare benefits on the partnership status of women in the UK. Using recent policy reforms to identify the response rate I find that a \u00a3100/week welfare benefit \"partnership penalty\" reduces the probability of a woman having a partner by seven percentage points. I also use the model to explore the potential effects of the recent Tax Credit reforms on partnership rates; I find that while the 1999 WFTC reform improved partnership incentives this effect was effectively undone by the 2003 WTC/CTC reform."

      "Many countries face the problem of how to reform social security systems to cope with increasing life expectancy. This raises questions concerning both distribution and risk sharing across generations. These issues are addressed within an OLG model with stochastic life expectancy across generations and endogenous retirement decisions. The social optimum is shown to imply that retirement age should be proportional to longevity. Moreover, increasing longevity calls for pre-funding even if the utility of all generations is weighted equal to the objective discount rate. The social optimum cannot be decentralized due to a conflict between incentives and risk sharing. The implications of stylized social security systems for risk sharing and retirement incentives are analyzed."

      "Scarce interconnector capacities are a severe obstacle to transregional competition and a unified market for electricity in the European Union. However, physically the interconnectors are rarely used up to capacity. This is due to the fact that the current allocation schemes make only limited use of the fact that currents in opposing directions cancel out. We propose a netting auction mechanism which makes use of this and in which even small transmission capacities can generate large competitive pressure in adjacent markets. Netting increases the usage of capacity and reduces the auctioneer's incentive to withhold capacity from the auction."

      "Theoretical and empirical studies of different sciences suggest that an optimal committee consists of roughly 5-9 members, although it can swell mildly under specific circumstances. This paper develops a conceptual model in order to analyze the issue in case of monetary policy formulation. The optimal monetary policy committee (MPC) size varies according to the uncertainty of MPC members' information influenced by the size of the monetary zone and overall economic stability. Our conceptual model is backed up with econometric evidence using a survey of 85 countries. The MPC size of large monetary zones (EMU, USA, Japan) is close to the estimated optimal level, but there exist several smaller countries with too many or too few MPC members."

      "We study effects of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) in the prescription drug market. There are two pharmaceutical firms providing horizontally differentiated (branded) drugs. Patients differ in their susceptibility to the drugs. If DTCA is allowed, this can be employed to induce (additional) patient visits. Physicians perfectly observe the patients' type (of illness), but rely on information to prescribe the correct drug. Drug information is conveyed by marketing (detailing), creating a captive and a selective segment of physicians. First, we show that detailing, DTCA and price (if not regulated) are complementary strategies for the firms. Thus, allowing DTCA induces more detailing and higher prices. Second, firms benefit from DTCA if detailing competition is not too fierce, which is true if investing in detailing is sufficiently costly. Otherwise, firms are better off with a ban on DTCA. Finally, DTCA tends to lower welfare if insurance is generous (low copayments) and/or price regulation is lenient. The desirability of DTCA also depends on whether or not the regulator is concerned with firms' profit."

It focuses on policies that rely on economic incentives, such as taxes, deposit-refunds, and recycled content standards. The paper addresses the relative cost effectiveness of these approaches and also considers the overall desirability of government intervention to reduce lead disposal."

      "Studies examining the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs present findings that are mixed and sometimes at odds, in part due to research design, data, and methodological limitations of the studies. We aim to substantially improve on past approaches to estimate program effectiveness by using administrative data on welfare recipients in Missouri and North Carolina to obtain separate estimates of the effects of participating in sub-programs of each state's welfare-to-work program. Using data on all women who entered welfare between the second quarter of 1997 and fourth quarter of 1999 in these states, we follow recipients for sixteen quarters and model their quarterly earnings as a function of demographic characteristics, prior welfare and work experience, the specific types of welfare-to-work programs in which they participate, and time since participation. We focus primarily on three types of subprograms?assessment, job readiness and job search assistance, and more intensive programs designed to augment human capital skills?and use a variety of methods that allow us to compare how common assumptions influence results. In general, we find that the impacts of program participation are negative in the quarters immediately following participation but improve over time, in most cases turning positive in the second year after participation. The results also show that more intensive training is associated with greater initial earnings losses but also greater earnings gains in the long run."
